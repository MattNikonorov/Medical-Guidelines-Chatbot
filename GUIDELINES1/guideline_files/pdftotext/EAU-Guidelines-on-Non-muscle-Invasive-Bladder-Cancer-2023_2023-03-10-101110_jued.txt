NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

1.

INTRODUCTION

1.1

Aim and scope

This overview represents the updated European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines for Non-muscleinvasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC), TaT1 and carcinoma in situ (CIS). The information presented is limited to
urothelial carcinoma (UC), unless specified otherwise. The aim is to provide practical recommendations on
the clinical management of NMIBC with a focus on clinical presentation and recommendations. Separate
EAU Guidelines are available addressing upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) [1], muscle-invasive and
metastatic bladder cancer (MIBC) [2] and primary urethral carcinoma [3]. It must be emphasised that clinical
guidelines present the best evidence available to the experts, but following guideline recommendations will
not necessarily result in the best outcome. Guidelines can never replace clinical expertise when making
treatment decisions for individual patients, but rather help to focus decisions - also taking personal values and
references/individual circumstances of patients into account. Guidelines are not mandates and do not purport
to be a legal standard of care.

1.2

Panel composition

The EAU Guidelines Panel on NMIBC consists of an international multidisciplinary group of clinicians, including
urologists, uro-oncologists, a pathologist, and a statistician. Members of this Panel have been selected based
on their expertise and to represent the professionals treating patients suspected of suffering from bladder
cancer. In the course of 2021 two patient representatives have formally joined the NMIBC Panel. All experts
involved in the production of this document have submitted potential conflict of interest statements which can
be viewed on the EAU website Uroweb: https://uroweb.org/guideline/non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/.

1.3

Available publications

A quick reference document (Pocket guidelines) is available. This is an abridged version which may require
consultation together with the full text version. Several scientific publications are available, the latest
publication dating to 2022 [4], as are a number of translations of all versions of the EAU NMIBC Guidelines.
All documents are accessible through the EAU website Uroweb: https://uroweb.org/guideline/non-muscleinvasive-bladder-cancer/.

•	Section 5.1 Transurethral resection of TaT1 tumours has been revised and restructured, in
particular ‘New methods of tumour visualisation’, the inclusion of Table 5.1 TURBT checklist,
with changes to recommendations:
Recommendations
2022 recommendation: Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder neck
tumour, if bladder carcinoma in situ is present or suspected, if there is positive cytology or
urinary molecular marker test without evidence of tumour in the bladder, or if abnormalities
of the prostatic urethra are visible. If biopsy is not performed during the initial procedure, it
should be completed at the time of the second resection.
Revised 2023 recommendation: Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder
neck tumour, if there is positive cytology or urinary molecular marker test without evidence
of tumour in the bladder, or if abnormalities of the prostatic urethra are visible. If biopsy is
not performed during the initial procedure, it should be performed at the time of the second
resection.
2022 recommendation: Take a prostatic urethral biopsy from the pre-collicular area (between
the 5 and 7 o’clock position) using a resection loop. In case any abnormal-looking areas in
the prostatic urethra are present at this time, these need to be biopsied as well.
Revised 2023 recommendation: Take a prostatic urethral biopsy from the pre-collicular area
(between the 5 and 7 o’clock position) using a resection loop.
2022 recommendation: The TURB record must describe tumour location, appearance, size
and multifocality, all steps of the procedure, as well as extent and completeness of resection.
Revised 2023 recommendation: The TURB record must describe tumour location,
appearance, size and multifocality, all steps of the procedure, extent, macroscopic
completeness of resection as well as any complications.

2022 recommendation: In patients with tumours presumed to be at low risk and in those
Strong
with small papillary recurrences (presumably Ta LG/G1) detected more than one year after
previous TURB, offer one immediate chemotherapy instillation.
Revised 2023 recommendation: In patients with tumours presumed to be at low risk and in
Strong
those with small papillary recurrences (presumably Ta LG/G1) detected more than one year

New 2023 recommendation: Offer post-operative saline or water continuous irrigation of the Strong
bladder to patients who cannot receive a single instillation of chemotherapy.
New 2023 recommendation: Patients with small recurrent low grade Ta tumours can be
Strong
effectively and safely offered office fulguration.
New 2023 recommendation: Only offer active surveillance to selected patients with presumed Strong
low-risk tumours not amendable to endoscopic ablation.
2022 recommendation: In patients with intermediate-risk tumours (with or without immediate Strong
instillation), offer one-year full- dose Bacillus Calmette- Guérin (BCG) treatment (induction
plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), or instillations of chemotherapy (the
optimal schedule is not known) for a maximum of one year.
The final choice should be made in a shared decision-making process with the patient,
reflecting his/her risk of recurrence and progression, as well as the efficacy and side effects
of each treatment modality.
Revised 2023 recommendation: In patients with intermediate-risk tumours (with or without
Strong
immediate instillation), one-year full- dose Bacillus Calmette- Guérin (BCG) treatment
(induction plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), or instillations of chemotherapy

2022 recommendation: In patients with high-risk tumours, full-dose intravesical BCG for
Strong
one to 3 years (induction plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months),
is indicated. The additional beneficial effect of the second and third years of maintenance
should be weighed against its added costs, side effects and problems connected with BCG
shortages. Immediate radical cystectomy (RC) may also be discussed with the patient.

METHODS

2.1

Data Identification

For the 2022 NMIBC Guidelines, new and relevant evidence has been identified, collated, and appraised
through a structured assessment of the literature.
A broad and comprehensive scoping exercise covering all areas of the NMIBC Guidelines
was performed. Excluded from the search were basic research studies, case series, reports, and editorial
comments. Only articles published in the English language, addressing adults, were included. The search was
restricted to articles published between June 3rd 2021 and May 4th 2022. Databases covered by the search
included Pubmed, Ovid, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews. After deduplication, a total of 825 unique records were identified, retrieved,
and screened for relevance.
A total of 72 new references were added to the 2023 NMIBC Guidelines. A detailed search strategy is
available online: https://uroweb.org/guideline/non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/?type=appendicespublications.
For Chapters 3 through 6 (Epidemiology, Aetiology and Pathology, Staging and Classification systems,
Diagnosis, Predicting disease recurrence and progression) the references used in this text were assessed
according to their level of evidence (LE) based on the 2009 Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine
(CEBM) Levels of Evidence [9]. For the Disease Management and Follow-up chapters (Chapters 7 and 8) a
system modified from the 2009 CEBM levels of evidence was used [9].
For each recommendation within the guidelines there is an accompanying online strength rating form which
includes the assessment of the benefit to harms ratio and patients‘ preferences for each recommendation.
The strength rating forms draws on the guiding principles of the GRADE methodology but do not purport to be
GRADE [10, 11]. Each strength rating form addresses a number of key elements namely:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

the overall quality of the evidence which exists for the recommendation [9];
the magnitude of the effect (individual or combined effects);
the certainty of the results (precision, consistency, heterogeneity and other statistical or
study related factors);
the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes;
the impact of patient values and preferences on the intervention;
the certainty of those patient values and preferences.

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

These key elements are the basis which panels use to define the strength rating of each recommendation. The
strength of each recommendation is represented by the words ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ [12]. The strength of each
recommendation is determined by the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative
management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including certainty of estimates), and nature and variability
of patient values and preferences.
Additional information can be found in the general Methodology section of this print, and online at
the EAU website; http://www.uroweb.org/guideline/. A list of associations endorsing the EAU Guidelines can
also be viewed online at the above address.

2.2

Review

The 2021 publication was peer reviewed prior to print.

2.3

Future goals

The findings of the ongoing ‘Individual Patient Data Validation of the Definition of bacillus Calmette-Guérin
(BCG) Failure/BCG Unresponsive in Patients with Non-muscle Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder: an
international multicentre retrospective study’ will be included in the future update of the NMIBC Guidelines.

EPIDEMIOLOGY, AETIOLOGY AND
PATHOLOGY

3.1

Epidemiology

Bladder cancer (BC) is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer in the male population worldwide, and
it is the tenth when both genders are considered [13]. The worldwide age-standardised incidence rate (per
100,000 person/years) is 9.5 in men and 2.4 in women [13]. In the European Union, the age-standardised
incidence rate is 20 in men and 4.6 in women [13].
Worldwide, the BC age-standardised mortality rate (per 100,000 person/years) is 3.3 for men vs.
0.86 for women [13]. Bladder cancer incidence and mortality rates vary across countries due to differences
in risk factors, detection and diagnostic practices, and variations in access to, and delivery of, healthcare.
Additionally, epidemiological variations have been attributed to differing methodologies and the quality of data
from individual datasets [14]. The incidence and mortality of BC has decreased in some registries, possibly
reflecting the decreased impact of causative factors [15].
Approximately 75% of patients with BC present with a disease confined to the mucosa (stage Ta,
CIS) or submucosa (stage T1); in younger patients (< 40 years of age) this percentage is even higher [16].
Patients with TaT1 and CIS have a high disease prevalence due to long-term survival in many cases and lower
risk of cancer-specific mortality compared to patients with T2-4 disease [13, 14].

3.2

Aetiology

3.2.1
Main risk factors
3.2.1.1
Tobacco
Tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for BC, accounting for approximately 50% of cases [14,
15, 17-19] (LE: 3). The aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the tobacco smoke,
which undergo renal excretion, are linked to the development of BC. The risk of BC increases with smoking
duration and intensity [18]. Low-tar cigarettes are not associated with a lower risk of developing BC [18]. The
risk associated with electronic cigarettes has not been adequately assessed; however, carcinogens have
been identified in the urine with electronic cigarettes [20]. ‘Second-hand’ exposure to tobacco smoke is also
associated with an increased risk of BC [14].
3.2.1.2
Occupational exposure
Occupational exposure to aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons is
the second most important risk factor for BC, accounting for about 10% of all cases. This type of occupational
exposure occurs mainly in industrial plants which process paint, dye, metal, and petroleum products [14, 15,
21, 22]. In developed industrial settings these risks have been reduced by work-safety guidelines; therefore,
chemical workers no longer have a higher incidence of BC compared to the general population [14, 21, 22].
Recently, greater occupational exposure to diesel exhaust has been suggested as a significant risk factor (odds
ratio [OR]: 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08–2.40) [23].

3.2.2
Genetic
Family history seems to have little impact [24]. To date, no clinically relevant genetic alteration has been linked
to BC. Genetic predisposition may lead to a higher susceptibility to other risk factors, and thereby explain
the familiar clustering of BC in first- and second-degree relatives (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.47−1.95)
[14, 25-30] that has been confirmed more recently [31]. A recent study identified three single nucleotide
polymorphisms related to the development of aggressive NMIBC [32]. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to
support genetic screening for BC.
3.2.3
Dietary habits
Dietary habits seem to have limited impact on the risk of developing BC. A protective impact of flavonoids
has been suggested. The Mediterranean diet, characterised by a high consumption of vegetables and nonsaturated fat (olive oil) with moderate consumption of protein, has been linked to some reduction of BC risk
(HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.77−0.93) [33-38]. Western diet (high in saturated fats) and organ meat has been shown to
increase the risk of BC in a recent meta-analysis [39, 40]. The impact of an increased consumption of fruits has
been suggested to reduce the risk of BC. This effect has been demonstrated to be significant in women only
(HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–0.99) [41]. Higher consumption of tea has been associated with a reduction in risk of
BC but only among men with also an interaction with tobacco smoking, thus making the protective effect of
this compound questionable [42].
3.2.4
Environmental exposure
Although the impact of drinking habits remains uncertain, the chlorination of drinking water and subsequent
levels of trihalomethanes are potentially carcinogenic. Additionally, exposure to arsenic in drinking water has
been suggested to increase the risk of BC [14, 43] (LE: 3). Arsenic intake and smoking have a combined effect
[44]. However, chronic exposure to nitrate in drinking water does not seem to be associated with increased risk
of BC [45].
The association between personal hair dye use and risk of BC remains uncertain; an increased risk has been
suggested in users of permanent hair dyes with a slow NAT2 acetylation phenotype [14] but a large prospective
cohort study could not identify an association between hair dye and risk of cancer and cancer-related
mortality [46].
3.2.5
Other
The impact of metabolic factors (body mass index, blood pressure, plasma glucose, cholesterol, and
triglycerides) remains uncertain [47]. However, data suggest that high circulating levels of vitamin D are
associated with a reduction in the risk of BC [48]. Schistosomiasis, which is an infection caused by a parasitic
trematode, can lead to BC [14] (LE: 3).
Exposure to pelvic ionizing radiation is associated with an increased risk of BC [49]. In a
retrospective analysis of patients with localised prostate cancer, external beam radiotherapy was independently
associated with the risk to develop a second primary BC [49]. A weak association was also suggested for
cyclophosphamide and pioglitazone [14, 43, 50] (LE: 3).

PATHOLOGICAL STAGING AND
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS

4.1

Definition of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer

Tumours confined to the mucosa and invading the lamina propria are classified as stage Ta and T1,
respectively, according to the Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification system [51]. Intra-epithelial, highgrade (HG) tumours confined to the mucosa are classified as CIS (Tis). All of these tumours can be treated by
transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), eventually in combination with intravesical instillations and are
therefore grouped under the heading of NMIBC for therapeutic purposes. The term ‘Non-muscle-invasive BC’
represents a group definition and all tumours should be characterised according to their stage, grade, and
further pathological characteristics (see Sections 4.5 and 4.7 and the International Collaboration on Cancer
Reporting website: http://www.iccr-cancer.org/datasets/published-datasets/urinary-male-genital/bladder. The
term ‘superficial BC’ should no longer be used as it is incorrect.

4.2

Tumour, Node, Metastasis Classification (TNM)

The latest TNM classification approved by the Union International Contre le Cancer (UICC) (8th Edn.) is referred
to (Table 4.1) [51].

4.3

T1 subclassification

The depth and extent of invasion into the lamina propria (T1 sub-staging) has been demonstrated to be of
prognostic value in retrospective cohort studies [51, 52] (LE: 3). Its use is recommended by the most recent
2022 World Health Organization (WHO) classification [53, 54]. T1 sub-staging methods are based either on
micrometric (T1e and T1m) or histo-anatomic (T1a and T1b) principles; the optimal classification system,
however, remains to be defined [55, 56].

4.4

Lymphovascular invasion

The presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in TURB specimens is associated with an increased risk of
pathological upstaging and worse prognosis [57-61] (LE: 3). Immunohistochemistry for confirmation is not
mandatory [56].

4.5

Histological grading of non-muscle-invasive bladder urothelial carcinomas

4.5.1
Types of histological grading systems
In 2004 the WHO published a histological classification system for UCs including papillary urothelial
neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP), non-invasive papillary carcinoma low grade (LG) and HG.
This system was also taken into the updated 2016/2022 WHO classifications [53, 54]. It provides a different
patient stratification between individual categories compared to the older 1973 WHO classification, which
distinguished between grade 1 (G1), grade 2 (G2) and grade 3 (G3) categories [55, 62].
There is a significant shift of patients between the categories of the WHO 1973 and the WHO
2004/2022 systems (see Figure 4.1), for example an increase in the number of HG patients (WHO 2004/2022)
due to inclusion of a subset of G2 patients with a more favourable prognosis compared to the G3 category
(WHO 1973) [63]. According to a multi-institutional individual patient data analysis, the proportion of tumours
classified as PUNLMP (WHO 2004/2016) has decreased to very low levels in the last decade [64].
4.5.2
Prognostic value of histological grading
A systematic review and meta-analysis did not show that the 2004/2016 classification outperforms the 1973
classification in prediction of recurrence and progression [63] (LE: 2a).
To compare the prognostic value of both WHO classifications, an individual patient data analysis of
5,145 primary TaT1 NMIBC patients from 16 centres throughout Europe and one in Canada was conducted.
Patients had a transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) followed by intravesical instillations at the
physician’s discretion. In this large study, the WHO 1973 and the WHO 2004/2016 were both prognostic
for progression but not for recurrence. When compared, the WHO 1973 was a stronger prognosticator of
progression in TaT1 NMIBC than the WHO 2004/2016. However, a 4-tier combination LG/G1, LG/G2, HG/G2
and HG/G3) of both classification systems proved to be superior to either classification system alone, as it
divides the large group of G2 patients into two subgroups (LG/HG) with different prognoses [65]. In a subgroup
of 3,311 patients with primary Ta bladder tumours, a similar prognosis was found for PUNLMP and Ta LG
carcinomas [65].
4.5.3
Clinical application of histological grading systems
•
The WHO 2002/2022 classification system is currently supported by the WHO for clinical application.
Nevertheless, the WHO 1973 is still being used.
•
The most important parameters, which must be considered for clinical application of any grading system
are its inter-observer reproducibility and prognostic value (see Sections 4.5.1 and 4.6).
•
These guidelines provide recommendations for tumours classified by both classification systems.

4.6

Carcinoma in situ and its classification

Carcinoma in situ is an intra-epithelial, HG, non-invasive UC. It can be missed or misinterpreted as an
inflammatory lesion during cystoscopy if not biopsied. Carcinoma in situ is often multifocal and can occur in
the bladder, but also in the upper urinary tract (UUT), prostatic ducts and urethra [66].

12

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

From a clinical point of view, CIS may be classified as [67]:
•
Primary: isolated CIS with no previous or concurrent papillary tumours and no previous CIS;
•
Secondary: CIS detected during follow-up of patients with a previous tumour that was not CIS;
•
Concurrent: CIS in the presence of any other urothelial tumour in the bladder.

4.7

Inter- and intra-observer variability in staging and grading

There is significant variability among pathologists for the diagnosis of CIS, for which agreement is achieved in
only 70–78% of cases [68] (LE: 2a). There is also inter-observer variability in the classification of stage T1 vs.
Ta tumours and tumour grading in both the 1973 and 2022 classifications. The general conformity between
pathologists in staging and grading is 50–60% [69-72] (LE: 2a). The WHO 2004/2016 classification provides
slightly better reproducibility than the 1973 classification [63].

4.8

Subtypes of urothelial carcinoma

Currently the following differentiations of UC are used [73, 74]:
1.
urothelial carcinoma (more than 90% of all cases);
2.
urothelial carcinomas with partial squamous and/or glandular or divergent differentiation;
3.
micropapillary UC;
4.
nested/microcystic variant;
5.
large nested variant;
6.
microtubular UC;
7.
plasmacytoid, signet ring
8.
lymphoepithelioma-like;
9.
giant cell, diffuse, undifferentiated;
10.
sarcomatoid UC;
11.
some UCs with other rare differentiations;
12.
urothelial carcinomas with partial NE (neuroendocrine differentiation, % to be given);
13.
pure neuroendocrine carcinoma (including small and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas [Chapter
NE carcinomas in the genitourinary tract]).
In the new WHO 2022 all subtypes are considered HG [54]. The percentage of subtype in the specimen should be
reported since it has been shown to be of prognostic value [75]. The majority are MIBC which is pure
HG UC, and no more than 15–30% are non-muscle invasive [2, 75-82] (LE: 3).

4.9

Tumour markers and molecular classification

Tumour markers and their prognostic role have been investigated [83-87]. These methods, in particular
complex approaches such as the stratification of patients based on molecular classification, are promising but
have not yet been recommended by any pathological organisation and are therefore not suitable for routine
application [56, 88, 89].

4.10

Summary of evidence and guidelines for bladder cancer classification

Summary of evidence
The depth of invasion (staging) is classified according to the TNM classification.
Tumours confined to the mucosa and invading the lamina propria are classified as stage Ta and T1,
respectively. Flat, high-grade tumours that are confined to the mucosa are classified as CIS (Tis).
Histological grading of urothelial NMIBC is classified according to the WHO 1973 (G1–G3) and/or the
WHO 2004/2016 (PUNLMP, LG/HG) systems.
Both the WHO 1973 and the 2004/2016 classification systems are prognostic for progression, but not
for recurrence.
The WHO 1973 is a stronger prognosticator of progression in TaT1 NMIBC than the WHO 2004/2022.
However, a 3-tier hybrid (LG/G1-G2, HG/G2 & HG/G3) or a 4-tier hybrid LG/G1, LG/G2, HG/G2 and HG/
G3) combination of both classification systems proved to be superior to either classification system alone.
The WHO 2004/2022 classification provides better reproducibility than the 1973 classification.
PUNLMP lesions have the same prognosis as Ta LG carcinomas.
Recommendations
Use the 2017 TNM system for classification of the depth of tumour invasion (staging).
Use both the 1973 and 2004/2022 WHO classification systems, or a hybrid system.
Do not use the term ‘superficial’ bladder cancer.

DIAGNOSIS

5.1

Patient history

A focused patient history is mandatory.

5.2

Signs and symptoms

Haematuria is the most common finding in NMIBC. Visible haematuria was found to be associated with higher
stage at diagnosis disease compared to nonvisible haematuria [90]. Carcinoma in situ might be suspected in
patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, especially irritative voiding symptoms.

5.3

Physical examination

A focused urological examination is mandatory although it does not reveal NMIBC.

5.4

Imaging

5.4.1
Computed tomography urography and intravenous urography
Computed tomography (CT) urography is used to detect papillary tumours in the urinary tract, indicated by
filling defects and/or hydronephrosis [91].
Intravenous urography (IVU) is an alternative if CT is not available [92] (LE: 2b), but particularly in muscleinvasive tumours of the bladder and in UTUCs, CT urography provides more information (including status of
lymph nodes and neighbouring organs).
The necessity to perform a baseline CT urography once a bladder tumour has been detected is
questionable due to the low incidence of significant findings which can be obtained [93-95] (LE: 2b). The
incidence of UTUCs is low (1.8%), but increases to 7.5% in tumours located in the trigone [94] (LE: 2b). The
risk of UTUC during follow-up increases in patients with multiple and high-risk tumours [96] (LE: 2b).
5.4.2
Ultrasound
Ultrasound (US) may be performed as an adjunct to physical examination as it has moderate sensitivity to a
wide range of abnormalities in the upper- and lower urinary tract. It permits characterisation of renal masses,
detection of hydronephrosis, and visualisation of intraluminal masses in the bladder, but cannot rule out all
potential causes of haematuria [97, 98] (LE: 3). It cannot reliably exclude the presence of UTUC and cannot
replace CT urography.
5.4.3
Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging
The role of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has not yet been established in BC
diagnosis and staging. A standardised methodology of MRI reporting (Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data
System [VI-RADS]) in patients with BC has recently been published and requires further validation [99]. A first
systematic review of 8 studies showed that the VI-RADS scoring system can accurately differentiate NMIBC
from MIBC with high inter-observer agreement rates [100].
A diagnosis of CIS cannot be made with imaging methods alone (CT urography, IVU, US or MRI) (LE: 4).

5.5

Urinary cytology

The examination of voided urine or bladder-washing specimens for exfoliated cancer cells has high sensitivity
in HG and G3 tumours (84%), but low sensitivity in LG/G1 tumours (16%) [101]. The sensitivity in CIS detection
is 28–100% [102] (LE: 1b). Cytology is useful, particularly as an adjunct to cystoscopy, in patients with HG/
G3 tumours; it is not designed to detect LG tumours. Positive voided urinary cytology can indicate an UC
anywhere in the urinary tract; negative cytology, however, does not exclude its presence.
Cytological interpretation is user-dependent [103, 104] and evaluation can be hampered by low cellular yield,
urinary tract infections, stones, or intravesical instillations: although in experienced hands specificity exceeds
90% [103] (LE: 2b). Artificial intelligence algorithms combined with digital image processing (VisioCyt test)
improved the sensitivity of cytology for HG tumours up to 92% [105].
A standardised reporting system known as The Paris System published in 2022 (2nd Edn.) redefined urinary
cytology diagnostic categories as follows [106]:
•
No adequate diagnosis possible (No diagnosis);
•
Negative for UC (Negative);
•
Atypical urothelial cells (Atypia);
•
Suspicious for HG UC (Suspicious);
•
High-grade/G3 UC (Malignant).

14

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

The principle of the system and its terminology underlines the role of urinary cytology in detection of G3 and
HG tumours. The Paris system for reporting urinary cytology has been validated in several retrospective studies
[107, 108].
Urine collection should respect the recommendation provided in Section 5.9. One cytospin slide from the
sample is usually sufficient [109]. In patients with suspicious cytology repeat investigation is advised [110] (LE: 2b).

5.6

Urinary molecular marker tests

Driven by the low sensitivity of urine cytology in LG/G1 tumours, numerous urinary tests have been developed
[111]. None of these markers have been accepted as routine practice by any clinical guidelines for diagnosis or
follow-up.
The following conclusions can be drawn regarding the existing tests:
•
Sensitivity is usually higher at the cost of lower specificity compared to urine cytology [112-117] (LE: 3).
•
Benign conditions and previous BCG instillations may influence the results of many urinary marker tests
[112-114] (LE: 1b).
•
Requirements for sensitivity and specificity of a urinary marker test largely depend on the clinical context
of the patient (screening, primary detection, follow-up [high-risk, low/intermediate-risk]) [113, 114] (LE: 3).
•
The wide range in performance of the markers and low reproducibility may be explained by patient
selection and complicated laboratory methods required [114, 115, 118-125].
•
Positive results of cytology, UroVysion™ (FISH), Nuclear Matrix Protein (NMP)22®, Fibroblast Growth
Factor Receptor (FGFR)3/Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) and microsatellite analysis in patients
with negative cystoscopy and upper tract work-up, may identify patients more likely to experience
disease recurrence and possibly progression [118, 121, 124-129] (LE: 2b).
•
Promising novel urinary biomarkers, assessing multiple targets, have been tested in prospective
multicentre studies [119, 120, 124, 130-133]. Four of the promising and commercially available urine
biomarkers, Cx-Bladder [119, 133], ADX-BladderTM [134, 135], Xpert Bladder® [136, 137] and EpiCheckTM
[132], although not tested in RCTs, have such high sensitivities and negative predictive values in the
referenced studies for HG disease that these biomarkers may approach the sensitivity of cystoscopy.
These 4 tests might be used to replace and/or postpone cystoscopy as they may identify the rare HG
recurrences occurring in low/intermediate NMIBC.

5.7

Potential application of urinary cytology and markers

The following objectives of urinary cytology or molecular tests must be considered.
5.7.1
Screening of the population at risk of bladder cancer
The application of haematuria dipstick, followed by FGFR3, NMP22® or UroVysionTM tests if dipstick is positive
has been reported in BC screening in high-risk populations [138, 139]. However, the low incidence of BC in the
general population and the short lead-time impair feasibility and cost-effectiveness of BC screening [127, 139].
Thus, routine screening for BC is not recommended [127, 138, 139].
Exploration of patients after haematuria or other symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer
(primary detection)
IIt is generally accepted that none of the currently available tests can replace cystoscopy. However, urinary
cytology or biomarkers can be used as an adjunct to cystoscopy to detect missed tumours, particularly CIS.
In this setting, specificity is particularly important. Recently, CellDetect® and UroVysion™ have shown similar
performance to detect BC and were both superior to cytology [140]. In addition, Xpert Bladder® had higher
sensitivity and negative-predictive value than both cytology or UroVysion™ for the detection of BC in patients
with haematuria [141].
5.7.2

5.7.3
Surveillance of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
Research has been carried out into the usefulness of urinary cytology vs. markers in the follow-up of NMIBC
[118, 119, 131, 132, 142]. A recent systematic review and network meta-analysis showed high accuracy of
novel urinary biomarkers supporting their utility in the NMIBC surveillance setting [8].
5.7.3.1
Follow-up of high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
High-risk tumours should be detected early in follow-up and the percentage of tumours missed should be as
low as possible. Therefore, the best surveillance strategy for these patients will continue to include cystoscopy
and cytology (see Chapter 8).

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

15

5.7.3.2
Follow-up of low/intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
To reduce the number of cystoscopy procedures, urinary markers should be able to detect a recurrence before
the tumours are large, numerous and/or muscle invasive. The limitation of urinary cytology and current urinary
markers is their low sensitivity for LG recurrences [113, 118] (LE: 1b).
According to current knowledge, no urinary marker can replace cystoscopy during follow-up
or lower cystoscopy frequency in a routine fashion. One prospective randomised study (RCT) found that
knowledge of positive test results (microsatellite analysis) can improve the quality of follow-up cystoscopy [143]
(LE: 1b), supporting the adjunctive role of a non-invasive urine test performed prior to follow-up cystoscopy
[143] (see Section 8.1).

5.8

Cystoscopy

The diagnosis of papillary BC ultimately depends on cystoscopic examination of the bladder and histological
evaluation of sampled tissue by either cold-cup biopsy or resection. Carcinoma in situ can be suspected
through cystoscopy and urine cytology and confirmed by histological evaluation of multiple bladder biopsies [144].
Cystoscopy is initially performed as an outpatient procedure. A flexible instrument with topical
intraurethral anaesthetic lubricant instillation results in better compliance compared to a rigid instrument,
especially in men [145, 146] (LE: 1b).
To temporary increase the urethral pressure by irrigation ‘bag squeeze’ when passing membranous
and prostatic urethra with a flexible cystoscope in males also decreases pain during the procedure [147, 148].

Summary of evidence and guidelines for the primary assessment of non-muscleinvasive bladder cancer

Summary of evidence
Cystoscopy is necessary for the diagnosis of BC.
Urinary cytology has high sensitivity in high-grade tumours including carcinoma in situ.
Recommendations
Take a patient history, focusing on urinary tract symptoms and haematuria.
Use renal and bladder ultrasound and/or computed tomography-intravenous urography
(CT-IVU) during the initial work-up in patients with haematuria.

Once a bladder tumour has been detected, perform a CT urography in selected cases (e.g.,
tumours located in the trigone, multiple- or high-risk tumours).
Perform cystoscopy in patients with symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer or during
surveillance. It cannot be replaced by cytology or by any other non-invasive test.
In men, use a flexible cystoscope, if available, and apply irrigation ‘bag squeeze’ to
decrease procedural pain when passing the proximal urethra.
Describe all macroscopic features of the tumour (site, size, number, and appearance) and
mucosal abnormalities during cystoscopy. Use a bladder diagram (Figure 5.1).
Use voided urine cytology as an adjunct to cystoscopy to detect high-grade tumour.
Perform cytology on at least 25 mL fresh urine or urine with adequate fixation. First morning
urine is not suitable because of the frequent presence of cytolysis.
Use the Paris System 2nd Edn. for cytology reporting.

Transurethral resection of TaT1 bladder tumours

5.10.1
Strategy of the procedure
The goals of TURB in TaT1 BC is to establish accurate pathological diagnosis/staging and completely remove
all visible lesions. It is a crucial procedure in the management of BC. Transurethral resection of the bladder
tumours should be performed systematically in individual steps [6, 149] (see Section 5.14).
The operative steps necessary to achieve a successful TURB include identifying the factors required to assign
disease risk (number of tumours, size, architecture, location, concern for the presence of CIS, recurrent
vs. primary tumour), clinical stage (bimanual examination under anaesthesia, assignment of clinical tumour
stage), adequacy of the resection (visually complete resection, visualisation of muscle at the resection base),
visualisation of tumour in the distal ureter and presence of complications (assessment for perforation) [6, 150].
To measure the size of the largest tumour, one can use the end of the cutting loop, which is approximately 1 cm
wide, as a reference. Tumour architecture can be sessile, nodular, papillary, mixed papillary/solid or flat.
5.10.2
Surgical and technical aspects of tumour resection
5.10.2.1 Surgical strategy of resection (piecemeal/separate resection, en-bloc resection)
A complete resection, performed by either fractioned or en-bloc technique, is essential to achieve a good
prognosis [149, 151].
•
Piecemeal resection in fractions (separate resection of the exophytic part of the tumour, the underlying
bladder wall and the edges of the resection area) provides good information about the vertical and
horizontal extent of the tumour [152] (LE: 2b). Whilst this technique is carried out using a loop with
diathermy (monopolar or bipolar), the Thulium-YAG laser is potentially a feasible alternative [153].
•
En-bloc resection using monopolar or bipolar current, Thulium-YAG or Holmium-YAG or KTP-Green Light
lasers is feasible in selected exophytic tumours. It provides high-quality resected specimens with the
presence of detrusor muscle in 96–100% of cases [149, 154-160] (LE: 3). Respect of tumour architecture
increases the accuracy of T1 staging and the possibility of sub-staging while potentially reducing the risk
of bladder perforation [154, 159, 160] (LE: 1b).
The technique selected is dependent on the size and location of the tumour and experience of the surgeon.
With better detection of tumours and abnormal margins, methods of optical enhancement are expected to
improve complete resection (see Section 5.11). A recent RCT [161] did not confirm a higher rate of detrusor
muscle retrieval in en-bloc- compared to piecemeal resection [162].
5.10.2.2 Evaluation of resection quality
The absence of detrusor muscle in the specimen is associated with a significantly higher risk of residual
disease, early recurrence, and tumour under-staging [163] (LE: 1b). The presence of detrusor muscle in the
specimen is considered as a surrogate criterion of the resection quality [163] and is required (except in Ta LG/
G1 tumours). Surgical checklists and quality performance indicator programmes have shown to increase surgical
quality (accurate documentation of factors required to assign risk and sample detrusor muscle) and decrease
recurrence rates [6, 150, 164, 165]. The Panel have included a sample TURBT checklist in Table 5.1 (modified
and adapted from [5] and [6]).
It has been shown that surgical experience can improve TURB results, which supports the role of teaching
programmes [163, 166]. Virtual training on simulators is an emerging approach [167]. Its role in the teaching
process still needs to be established [6]. Surgical experience and/or volume has been associated with risk of
complications [168], recurrence [169] and survival [170] in retrospective studies (LE: 3).

5.10.2.3 Monopolar and bipolar resection
Compared to monopolar resection, bipolar resection has been introduced to reduce the risk of complications
(e.g., bladder perforation due to obturator nerve stimulation) and to produce better specimens. Currently, the
results remain controversial [171-173], with significant inherent limitations due to selection bias, heterogeneity
of surgical approach or inability to qualify surgeon experience. A systematic review of 13 RCTs (2,379 patients)
showed no benefit of bipolar vs. monopolar TURB for efficacy and safety [173] while one meta-analysis of
RCTs (n = 2,099) suggests a lower fall in haemoglobin and shorter hospital stay with bipolar resections [171]
and another systematic review of RCTs and observational studies (n = 19,927) suggests lesser thermal artifacts
in the specimen [172].
5.10.2.4 Resection of small papillary bladder tumours at the time of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
It is not uncommon to incidentally detect bladder tumours during TURP in men with benign prostatic
hyperplasia. Provided these tumours are papillary, rather small and not extensively multifocal, it seems feasible
to resect these tumours and continue with the resection of the prostate [174, 175]. Simultaneous TURB and
TURP does not appear to lead to any increased risk of tumour recurrence or progression [176] (LE: 3).

5.11

Endoscopic biopsies

5.11.1
Bladder biopsies
Carcinoma in situ can present as a velvet-like, reddish area, indistinguishable from inflammation, or it may
not be visible at all. For this reason, biopsies from suspicious urothelium should be taken. In patients with
positive urine cytology (see Section 5.5), and normal-looking mucosa at cystoscopy, mapping biopsies are
recommended [177, 178]. To obtain representative mapping of the bladder mucosa, biopsies should be taken
from the trigone, bladder dome, right, left, anterior and posterior bladder wall [177, 178]. If the equipment is
available, photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) is a useful tool to target the biopsy.
5.11.2
Prostatic urethral biopsies
Involvement of the prostatic urethra and ducts in men with NMIBC has been reported. Palou et al., showed
that in 128 men with T1G3 UC, the incidence of CIS in the prostatic urethra was 11.7% [179] (LE: 2b). The risk
of prostatic urethra or duct involvement is higher if the tumour is located at the trigone or bladder neck, in the
presence of bladder CIS and multiple tumours [180] (LE: 3b). Based on this observation, a biopsy from the
prostatic urethra is necessary in some cases (see recommendation in Section 5.14) [179, 181, 182].

5.12

New methods of tumour visualisation

As a standard procedure, cystoscopy and TURB are performed using white light (WL). However, the use of
WL alone can lead to missing lesions that are present but not visible, which is why new technologies are being
developed.
5.12.1
Photodynamic diagnosis (fluorescence cystoscopy or blue light cystoscopy)
Photodynamic diagnosis is performed using violet light after intravesical instillation of 5-aminolaevulinic acid
(ALA) or hexaminolaevulinic acid (HAL).
5.12.1.1 Impact on bladder cancer detection
It has been confirmed that fluorescence-guided biopsy and resection are more sensitive than conventional
procedures for the detection of malignant tumours, particularly CIS [183, 184] (LE: 1a). In a systematic review
and meta-analysis, PDD had higher sensitivity than WL endoscopy in the pooled estimates for analyses at both
the patient-level (92% vs. 71%) and biopsy-level (93% vs. 65%) [184]. A prospective RCT did not confirm a
higher detection rate in patients with known positive cytology before TURB [185].
Photodynamic diagnosis had lower specificity than WL endoscopy (63% vs. 81%) [184]. Falsepositivity can be induced by inflammation or recent TURB and during the first 3 months after BCG instillation
[186, 187] (LE: 1a).
5.12.1.2 Impact on bladder cancer recurrence
The beneficial effect of ALA or HAL fluorescence cystoscopy on recurrence rate in patients with TURB
was evaluated. A systematic review and analysis of 14 RCTs including 2,906 patients, 6 using 5-ALA and
9 HAL, demonstrated a decreased risk of BC recurrence in the short and long term. There were, however, no
differences in progression and mortality rates. The analysis demonstrated inconsistency between trials and
potential susceptibility to performance and publication bias [188] (LE: 1a). While a recent systematic review
and meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (n = 2,288) revealed lower risk of recurrence and improved time to recurrence
(at least in the first 2 years and possibly up to 5 years) with PDD [189] (LE: 1a), the most recent Cochrane
systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 RCTs (n = 4,325) demonstrated that PDD-assisted TURBT may

18

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

prolong not only recurrence over time but also risk of progression, albeit supported only by low certainty
evidence [190].
A recent RCT showed that PDD-guided TURBT did not reduce recurrence rates, nor was it costeffective compared with WL cystoscopy at 3 years [191]. The study was considered underpowered, potentially
having captured a diluted effect of PDD at 3 years (as opposed to the positive trend in time to recurrence seen
within the first 18 months) [192-194].
5.12.2
Narrow-band imaging
In narrow-band imaging (NBI), the contrast between normal urothelium and hyper-vascular cancer tissue is
enhanced. Improved cancer detection has been demonstrated by NBI flexible cystoscopy and NBI-guided
biopsies and resection [195-198] (LE: 3b). Two RCTs assessed the reduction of recurrence rates if NBI is
used during TURB [198, 199]. Although the overall results were negative, a benefit after 3 and 12 months was
observed for low-risk tumours (pTa LG, < 30 mm, no CIS) [199].
A systematic review and meta-analysis by Russo et al., (17 RCTs and non-RCTs) demonstrated improved
detection (diagnostic accuracy) of bladder tumours with either PDD or NBI over WL cystoscopy [200], while
another one (including 5,217 patients) showed improved RFS with either enhancement technique [201] (LE: 1a).
Conversely, a systematic review and network meta-analysis that took into account the use of single postoperative instillation of chemotherapy, concluded that there was a lower likelihood of recurrence at one year only
following PDD-guided TURB (with or without single instillation) but not with NBI-guided surgery [202] (LE: 1a).
5.12.3
IMAGE1 S™, and other technologies
IMAGE1 S™ (formerly named SPIES) is an image enhancement system based on a computerized processing
of different colour components that uses specific light filters. Limited evidence has been produced so far in
an attempt to validate the 4 different light spectra modalities, suggesting an improvement in the diagnostic
accuracy of WL [203, 204]. Early (18 months) follow-up data of an RCT failed to show an advantage in
recurrence rate in the IMAGE1 S™ arm over WL, except in a subgroup of primary low intermediate-risk
NMIBCs [205].
Confocal laser micro-endoscopy is a high-resolution imaging probe designed to provide endoscopic
histological grading in real time but requires further validation [206].

5.13

Second resection (second TURB)

5.13.1
Detection of residual disease and tumour upstaging
The significant risk of residual tumour after initial TURB of TaT1 lesions has been demonstrated [151] (LE:
1b). This residual cancer has the potential to worsen oncological outcomes and therefore further emphasises
the importance of an effective initial TURB. As patients with an initial incomplete TURB (either from extensive
tumour or intra-operative complications) will require a second completion resection, documentation of
resection completeness at the time of the initial TURB is essential.
A systematic review analysing data of 8,409 patients with Ta or T1 HG UC demonstrated a 51% risk
of persistence and an 8% risk of under-staging in T1 tumours. The analysis also showed a high risk of residual
disease in Ta tumours, but this observation was based only on a limited number of cases. Most of the residual
lesions were detected at the original tumour location [207] (LE: 1a).
Another systematic review and meta-analysis of 3,556 patients with T1 tumours showed that the
prevalence rate of residual tumours and upstaging to invasive disease after TURB remained high even in a
subgroup with detrusor muscle sampled at the initial TURB. In the subgroup of 1,565 T1 tumours with detrusor
muscle present, persistent tumour was found in 58% and under-staging occurred in 11% of cases [208].
Prospective trials suggest that post-operative positive urine cytology [209] and Xpert Bladder® (urine
mRNA test) [210] are independently associated with residual disease at second resection and risk of future
recurrences, respectively (LE: 2b). These data, however, need to be confirmed in further studies.
5.13.2
The impact of second resection on treatment outcomes
A second TURB can increase recurrence-free survival (RFS) [211, 212] (LE: 2a), improve outcomes after BCG
treatment [213] (LE: 3) and provide prognostic information [214-217] (LE: 3).
In a retrospective evaluation of a large multi-institutional cohort of 2,451 patients with BCG-treated
T1 G3/HG tumours (a second resection was performed in 935 patients), the second resection improved RFS,
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) only in patients without detrusor muscle in the initial
resection specimen [218] (LE: 3). In a retrospective analysis of 7,666 patients diagnosed with T1 cancer in
Ontario, 2,162 underwent a second resection; after adjusting for the effects of confounding variables, only OS

19

(and not CSS) was better in patients who underwent second resection [170] (LE: 3). This apparent improved
survival could also be the result of selection bias with fitter patients undergoing second resections. High-level
evidence is required to identify specific sub-groups of patients with high-grade cancer who are most likely to
benefit from a second resection.
5.13.3
Timing of second resection
Retrospective evaluation showed that a second resection performed 14–42 days after initial resection provides
longer RFS and PFS compared to second resection performed after 43–90 days [219] (LE: 3). Based on this
currently available evidence, a second TURB is recommended in selected cases 2 to 6 weeks after initial
resection [219] (for recommendations on patient selection, see Section 5.14).
5.13.4
Recording of results
The results of the second resection (residual tumours and under-staging) reflect the quality and effectiveness
of the initial TURB. As the goal is to improve the quality of the initial TURB, the results of the second resection
should be recorded.

5.14

Pathology report

Pathological investigation of the specimen(s) obtained by TURB and biopsies is an essential step in the
decision-making process for BC [220]. Close co-operation between urologists and pathologists is required.
Clinical information and high quality of resected and submitted tissue is essential for correct pathological
assessment. To obtain all relevant information, the specimen collection, handling and evaluation, should
respect the recommendations provided below (see Section 5.14) [221]. In difficult cases, an additional review
by an experienced genitourinary pathologist can be considered.

Summary of evidence and guidelines for transurethral resection of the bladder,
biopsies and pathology report

Summary of evidence
Transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURB) followed by pathology investigation of the
obtained specimen(s) is an essential step in the management of NMIBC.
The absence of detrusor muscle in the specimen is associated with a significantly higher risk of
residual disease and tumour under-staging (with the exception of Ta LG/G1 tumours).
A second TURB can detect residual tumours and tumour under-staging, increase recurrence-free
survival, improve outcomes after BCG treatment and provide prognostic information.
Recommendations
In patients suspected of having bladder cancer, perform a transurethral resection of the
bladder tumour (TURB) followed by pathology investigation of the obtained specimen(s) as
a diagnostic procedure and initial treatment step.
Perform TURB systematically in individual steps:
• bimanual palpation under anaesthesia;
• insertion of the resectoscope, under visual control with inspection of the whole urethra;
• inspection of the whole urothelial lining of the bladder;
• biopsy from the prostatic urethra (if indicated);
• cold-cup bladder biopsies (if indicated);
• resection of the tumour;
• recording of findings in the surgery report/record;
• precise description of the specimen(s) for pathology evaluation.
Performance of individual steps
Perform en-bloc resection or resection in fractions (exophytic part of the tumour, the
underlying bladder wall and the edges of the resection area).
Avoid cauterisation as much as possible during TURB to avoid tissue deterioration.
Take biopsies from abnormal-looking urothelium. Biopsies from normal-looking mucosa
(mapping biopsies from the trigone, bladder dome, right, left, anterior and posterior bladder
wall) are recommended if cytology or urinary molecular marker test is positive. If the
equipment is available, perform fluorescence-guided (PDD) biopsies.
Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder neck tumour, if there is positive
cytology or urinary molecular marker test without evidence of tumour in the bladder, or if
abnormalities of the prostatic urethra are visible. If biopsy is not performed during the initial
procedure, it should be performed at the time of the second resection.
Take a prostatic urethral biopsy from the pre-collicular area (between the 5 and 7 o’clock
position) using a resection loop.
Use methods to improve tumour visualisation (fluorescence cystoscopy, narrow-band
imaging) during TURB, if available.
Refer the specimens from different biopsies and resection fractions to the pathologist in
separately labelled containers.
The TURB record must describe tumour location, appearance, size and multifocality, all
steps of the procedure, extent, macroscopic completeness of resection as well as any
complications.
In patients with positive cytology, but negative cystoscopy, exclude an upper tract urothelial
carcinoma, CIS in the bladder (by mapping biopsies or PDD-guided biopsies) and tumour in
the prostatic urethra (by prostatic urethra biopsy).
Perform a second TURB in the following situations:
• after incomplete initial TURB, or in case of doubt about completeness of a TURB;
• if there is no detrusor muscle in the specimen after initial resection, with the
exception of Ta LG/G1 tumours and primary CIS;
• in T1 tumours.
If indicated, perform a second TURB within 2–6 weeks after the initial resection. This
second TURB should include resection of the primary tumour site.
Register the pathology results of a second TURB as it reflects the quality of the initial resection.
Inform the pathologist of prior treatments (intravesical therapy, radiotherapy, etc.).
The pathological report should specify tumour location, tumour grade and stage, lymphovascular invasion, subtypes of urothelial carcinoma, presence of CIS and detrusor muscle.

PREDICTING DISEASE RECURRENCE AND
PROGRESSION

6.1

TaT1 tumours

Treatment should take into account a patient’s prognosis. In order to predict the risk of disease recurrence and/
or progression, several prognostic models for specified patient populations have been introduced.
6.1.1
Scoring models using the WHO 1973 classification system
6.1.1.1
The 2006 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scoring model
To be able to predict both the short- and long-term risks of disease recurrence and progression in individual
patients, the EORTC Genito-Urinary Cancer Group (GUCG) published a scoring system and risk tables based
on the WHO 1973 classification in 2006 [222]. The scoring system is based on the 6 most significant clinical
and pathological factors in patients mainly treated by intravesical chemotherapy:
•
Number of tumours;
•
Tumour diameter;
•
Prior recurrence rate;
•
T category;
•
Concurrent CIS;
•
WHO 1973 tumour grade.
Using the 2006 EORTC scoring model, individual probabilities of recurrence and progression at 1 and 5 years
may be calculated (https://www.omnicalculator.com/health/eortc-bladder-cancer).
6.1.1.2
The model for patients with Ta G1/G2 (WHO 1973) tumours treated with chemotherapy
Patients with Ta G1/G2 tumours receiving chemotherapy were stratified into 3 risk groups for recurrence, taking
into account the history of recurrences, history of intravesical treatment, tumour grade (WHO 1973), number of
tumours and adjuvant chemotherapy [223].
6.1.1.3
Club Urologico Español de Tratamiento Oncologico (CUETO) scoring model for BCG-treated patients
A model that predicts the risk of recurrence and progression, based on 12 doses of intravesical BCG over a 5
to 6 months period following TURB, has been published by the CUETO (Spanish Urological Oncology Group).
It is based on an analysis of 1,062 patients from 4 CUETO trials that compared different intravesical BCG
treatments. No immediate post-operative instillation or second TURB was performed in these patients. The
scoring system is based on the evaluation of seven prognostic factors:
•
gender;
•
age;
•
prior recurrence status;
•
number of tumours;
•
T category;
•
associated CIS;
•
WHO 1973 tumour grade.
Using this model, the calculated risk of recurrence is lower than that obtained by the EORTC tables. For
progression, probability is lower only in high-risk patients [224] (LE: 2a). The lower risks in the CUETO tables
may be attributed to the use of BCG in this study. The prognostic value of the EORTC scoring system has been
confirmed by data from the CUETO patients treated with BCG [225] and by long-term follow-up in another
patient population [226] (LE: 2a).
6.1.1.4
The 2016 EORTC scoring model for patients treated with maintenance BCG
In 1,812 intermediate- and high-risk patients without CIS treated with 1 to 3 years of maintenance BCG,
the EORTC found that the prior disease-recurrence rate and number of tumours were the most important
prognostic factors for disease recurrence, stage and WHO 1973 grade for disease progression and diseasespecific survival, while age and WHO 1973 grade were the most important prognostic factors for OS. T1 G3
patients did poorly, with 1- and 5-year disease-progression rates of 11.4% and 19.8%, respectively. Using
these data, EORTC risk groups and nomograms for BCG-treated patients were developed [227] (LE: 2a).
6.1.2
Scoring model using the WHO 2004/2016 and WHO 1973 classification systems
6.1.2.1
EAU NMIBC 2021 scoring model
To update the risk of disease progression and create new prognostic factor risk groups using both the WHO
1973 and WHO 2004/2016 classification systems (without central pathology review), individual patient data
22

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

from 3,401 primary patients treated from 1990 to 2018 were used [65] (see Section 4.5). Only patients treated
with TURB ± intravesical chemotherapy were included, those treated with adjuvant intravesical BCG were
excluded because BCG may reduce the risk of disease progression. From the multivariate analyses, tumour
stage, WHO 1973 grade, WHO 2004/2022 grade, concomitant CIS, number of tumours, tumour size and age
were independent predictors of disease progression [65].
This is the only available model where the WHO 2004/2022 classification system is included as one of
the parameters to calculate an individual patient’s risk group and probability of progression. As the WHO
2004/2022 classification system is the main grading classification system used by pathologists, the Guidelines
Panel recommends to use the 2021 EAU NMIBC scoring model for risk groups definition (see Section 6.3).
The 2021 EAU NMIBC scoring model determines the risk of tumour progression, but not recurrence;
therefore any of the models mentioned in Section 6.1.1 may be used for calculation of an individual’s risk of
disease recurrence.
6.1.3
Further prognostic factors
Further prognostic factors have been described in selected patient populations:
•
In T1 HG/G3 tumours, important prognostic factors were female sex, CIS in the prostatic urethra in
men treated with an induction course of BCG, and age, tumour size and concurrent CIS in BCG-treated
patients (62% with an induction course only) [179, 228] (LE: 2b).
•
Attention must be given to patients with T1 HG/G3 tumours in bladder (pseudo) diverticulum because of
the absence of muscle layer in the diverticular wall [229] (LE: 3).
•
In patients with T1 tumours, the finding of residual T1 disease at second TURB is an unfavourable
prognostic factor [215-217] (LE: 3).
•
In patients with T1G2 tumours treated with TURB, recurrence at 3 months was the most important
predictor of progression [230] (LE: 2b).
•
The prognostic value of pathological factors has been discussed elsewhere (see Section 4.6). More
research is needed to determine the role of molecular markers in improving the predictive accuracy of
currently available risk tables [226, 231].

6.2

Carcinoma in situ

Without any treatment, approximately 54% of patients with CIS progress to muscle-invasive disease [232]
(LE: 3). There are no reliable prognostic factors, but some studies, however, have reported a worse prognosis
in concurrent CIS and T1 tumours compared to primary CIS [233, 234], in extended CIS [235] and in CIS in the
prostatic urethra [179] (LE: 3).
The response to intravesical treatment with BCG or chemotherapy is an important prognostic factor
for subsequent progression and death caused by BC [224, 225, 230]. Approximately 10 to 20% of complete
responders eventually experience disease progression to muscle-invasive disease, compared with 66% of nonresponders [236, 237] (LE: 2a).

6.3

Patient stratification into risk groups

To be able to facilitate treatment recommendations, the Guidelines Panel recommends the stratification of
patients into risk groups based on their probability of progression to muscle-invasive disease. The new risk
group definitions provided in these EAU Guidelines are based on an individual patient data analysis in primary
patients and the calculation of their progression scores (2021 EAU NMIBC scoring model) as presented in
Sections 4.5 and 6.1.2) [65].
For calculation of the risk group in individual patients, either one, or both, of the WHO 1973 and
WHO 2004/2016 classification systems may be used. The probability of progression at 5 years varies from less
than 1% to more than 40% between the risk groups.
For factors where individual patient data were not collected such as subtypes of UC, LVI, primary CIS and CIS
in the prostatic urethra; literature data have been used to classify patients into risk groups.
The clinical compositions of the new EAU NMIBC prognostic factor risk groups based on the WHO 2004/2016
or WHO 1973 classification systems are provided in Table 6.1. Apps for the web (www.nmibc.net), iOS
and Android (iOS / https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eau-nmibc-risk-calculator/id1578482687 and Android /
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ydeal.nmibc) have been developed to facilitate determining
a patient’s risk group in daily clinical practice. The individual probability of disease progression at 1, 5 and
10 years for the new EAU NMIBC risk groups is presented in Table 6.2. A single-centre study validated the EAU
NMIBC 2021 scoring model in 529 patients who received BCG [238]. The authors found that the progression
risk for the EAU 2021 high- and very high-risk groups were significantly lower in BCG-treated patients than that
in Table 6.2 [65]. These lower risks may be attributed to the use of BCG.

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

6.4

Summary of evidence and guidelines for stratification of non-muscle-invasive
bladder cancer

Summary of evidence
The EAU NMIBC 2021 scoring model and risk tables predict the short- and long-term risks of disease
progression in individual patients with primary NMIBC using either the WHO 1973 or the WHO 2022
classification system (see Section 6.1.2.1).
The 2006 EORTC scoring model and risk tables predict the short- and long-term risks of disease
recurrence and progression in individual patients with NMIBC using the WHO 1973 classification
system (see Section 6.1.1.1).
Patients with Ta G1/G2 tumours receiving chemotherapy have been further stratified into 3 risk groups
for recurrence, taking into account the history of recurrences, history of intravesical treatment, tumour
grade (WHO 1973), number of tumours and adjuvant chemotherapy (see Section 6.1.1.2).
In patients treated with 5 to 6 months of BCG, the CUETO scoring model predicts the short- and
long-term risks of disease recurrence and progression using the WHO 1973 classification system
(see Section 6.1.1.3).
In patients receiving at least 1 year of BCG maintenance; prior recurrence rate and number of tumours
are the most important prognostic factors for disease recurrence. Stage and grade are the most
important prognostic factors for disease progression and disease-specific survival; patient age and
grade (WHO 1973) are the most important prognostic factors for OS (see Section 6.1.1.4).
Recommendations
Stratify patients into 4 risk groups to predict progression, according to Table 6.1. A patient’s
risk group can be determined using the 2021 EAU risk group calculator available at
www.nmibc.net.
For information about the risk of disease progression in a patient with primary TaT1
tumours, not treated with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), use the data from Table 6.2.
Use the 2006 EORTC scoring model to predict the risk of tumour recurrence in individual
patients not treated with BCG.
Use the 2016 EORTC scoring model or the CUETO risk scoring model to predict the risk
of tumour recurrence in individual patients treated with BCG intravesical immunotherapy
(the 2016 EORTC model is calculated for 1 to 3 years of maintenance, the CUETO model
for 5 to 6 months).

It has been confirmed that smoking increases the risk of tumour recurrence and progression in NMIBC patients
[239, 240] (LE: 3). While it is still controversial whether smoking cessation in BC will favourably influence the
outcome of BC treatment, patients should be counselled to stop smoking due to the general health risks
associated with tobacco smoking [229, 241-243] (LE: 3).

7.2

Office-based fulguration and laser vaporisation

In patients with a history of small Ta LG/G1 tumours, fulguration, or laser vaporisation of small papillary
recurrences on an outpatient basis can reduce the therapeutic burden [244, 245] (LE: 3). In a prospective RCT,
laser photocoagulation with intravesical lidocaine in an outpatient setting proved non inferior to standard TURB
under general anaesthesia for the 4 months recurrence rate. Notably, the laser fulguration procedure resulted in
only a modest pain score (2.4) and was preferred by 98% of patients [246] (LE: 1b).

7.3

Active Surveillance

With recurrence in LG(G1)Ta tumours being more likely low grade and non-invasive [247-249] the risk of
progression to a higher grade or stage is infrequent to rare [250-252]. Expectant management or active
surveillance (AS), offer an alternative to TURB and office-based fulguration. Observing no progression to MIBC,
Soloway et al., first recommended this approach in 2003 [253] and Miyake et al., subsequently proposed an
algorithm for AS using changes in size and multifocality as triggers for intervention [254]. However, from a
review undertaken by the EAU Young Academic Urology group [255], it appears that the level of evidence in

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

25

favour of AS is low, with observational studies having heterogenous selection criteria, triggers for intervention
and surveillance tools. The multicentre prospective Bladder Cancer Italian Active Surveillance (BIAS) project,
conversely, demonstrated that AS is feasible in selected patients [256, 257]; however, additional evidence from
quality clinical trials is required.

7.4

Adjuvant intravesical treatment

Although TURB by itself can eradicate a TaT1 tumour completely, these tumours commonly recur and can
progress to MIBC. The high variability in the 3-month recurrence rate indicates that the TURB was incomplete
or provokes recurrences in a high percentage of patients [151]. It is therefore necessary to consider adjuvant
therapy in all patients.
7.4.1
Post-operative irrigation
Two systematic reviews [258, 259] and one meta-analysis [260] suggest efficacy of continuous irrigation in
the prevention of early recurrences. In case intravesical chemotherapy is not feasible, irrigation of the bladder
might be considered.
7.4.2
Intravesical chemotherapy
7.4.2.1
A single, immediate, post-operative intravesical instillation of chemotherapy
Immediate single instillation (SI) has been shown to act by destroying circulating tumour cells after TURB, and by
an ablative effect on residual tumour cells at the resection site and on small overlooked tumours [261-264] (LE: 3).
Four large meta-analyses comprising 1,476 to 3,103 patients have consistently shown that after
TURB, SI significantly reduces the recurrence rate compared to TURB alone [265-268] (LE: 1a). In a systematic
review and individual patient data meta-analysis of 2,278 eligible patients [265], SI reduced the 5-year recurrence
rate by 14%, from 59% to 45%. Only patients with primary tumours or intermediate-risk recurrent tumours with a
prior recurrence rate of < 1 recurrence/year and those with a 2006 EORTC recurrence score < 5 benefited from SI.
In patients with a 2006 EORTC recurrence score > 5 and/or patients with a prior recurrence rate of > 1 recurrence
per year, SI was not effective as a single adjuvant treatment. No randomised comparisons of individual drugs
have been conducted [265-268].
Single instillation with mitomycin C (MMC), epirubicin or pirarubicin [265], as well as gemcitabine [268],
have all shown to lower the intravesical recurrence rate. Single instillation with gemcitabine was superior to saline
in a RCT with approximately 200 patients per arm with remarkably low toxicity rates [269]. These findings are in
contrast with a previous study, which, however, used a shorter instillation time [270]. In the Böhle et al., study,
continuous saline irrigation was used for 24 hours post-operatively in both arms, which could explain the low
recurrence rate in the control arm [270].
Prevention of tumour cell implantation should be initiated within the first few hours after TURB. After that, tumour
cells are firmly implanted and are covered by the extracellular matrix [261, 271-273] (LE: 3). In all SI studies,
the instillation was administered within 24 hours. Two RCTs found no overall impact of SI with apaziquone; in
contrast, a post-hoc analysis did find a reduction of recurrence risk in patients receiving apaziquone within
90 minutes following TURB [274].
To maximise the efficacy of SI, one should devise flexible practices that allow the instillation to be given as soon
as possible after TURB, preferably within the first two hours in the recovery room or even in the operating theatre.
As severe complications have been reported in patients with drug extravasation, safety measures should be
maintained (see Section 7.7) [275, 276]. To allow for optimal compliance with this Level 1 evidence, clinical teams
are encouraged to explore barriers and facilitators within their practice [277].
7.4.2.2
Additional adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy instillations
The need for further adjuvant intravesical therapy depends on prognosis. In low-risk patients (Tables 6.1 and
6.2), a SI reduces the risk of recurrence and is considered to be the standard and complete treatment [265,
266] (LE: 1a). For other patients, however, a SI remains an incomplete treatment because of the considerable
likelihood of recurrence and/or progression (Tables 6.1 and 6.2). Efficacy data for the following comparisons of
application schemes were published.
Single installation only vs. SI and further repeat instillations
In one study, further chemotherapy instillations after SI improved RFS in intermediate-risk patients [278] (LE: 2a).
Repeat chemotherapy instillations vs. no adjuvant treatment
A large meta-analysis of 3,703 patients from 11 RCTs showed a highly significant (44%) reduction in the odds
of recurrence at one year in favour of chemotherapy over TURB alone [279]. This corresponds to an absolute

26

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

difference of 13–14% in the proportion of patients with recurrence. Contrary to these findings, two metaanalyses have demonstrated that BCG therapy may also reduce the risk of tumour progression [280, 281] (see
Section 7.2.2.1) (LE: 1a). Moreover, BCG maintenance therapy appears to be significantly better in preventing
recurrences than chemotherapy [282-284] (see Section 7.2.2.1) (LE: 1a). However, BCG causes significantly
more side effects than chemotherapy [284] (LE: 1a).
Single instillation + further repeat instillations vs. later repeat instillations only
There is evidence from several studies in intermediate-risk patients that SI might have an impact on recurrence
even when further adjuvant instillations are given [285-288]. A RCT including 2,243 NMIBC patients, which
compared SI of MMC with an instillation of MMC delayed two weeks after TURB (followed by further repeat
instillations in both treatment arms), showed a significant reduction of 9% in the risk of recurrence at 3 years in
favour of SI, from 36% to 27%. The effect was significant in the intermediate- and high-risk groups of patients
receiving additional adjuvant MMC instillations [285] (LE: 2a). Since the author’s definition of the risk groups
differed significantly in the initial publication, they adapted their patient stratification in the second analysis
and consistently showed improved efficacy of SI followed by repeat MMC instillations [289]. The results of
this study should be considered with caution since some patients did not receive adequate therapy. Another
RCT found no impact of SI with epirubicin followed by further chemotherapy or BCG instillations in a cohort of
predominant HR BC patients [290].
The optimal schedule of intravesical chemotherapy instillations
The length and frequency of repeat chemotherapy instillations is still controversial; however, it should not
exceed one year [288] (LE: 3).
7.4.2.3
Options for improving efficacy of intravesical chemotherapy
7.4.2.3.1 Adjustment of pH, duration of instillation, and drug concentration
Two prospective RCTs showed that optimized intravesical administration of MMC reduced recurrence rates,
either by a combination of measures (higher MMC-dose, peroral sodium bicarbonate, and refraining from
drinking) [291] and by adding cytosine arabinoside [292], respectively (LE: 1b). The value of these measures
in addition to alternative maintenance schedules is not known. Another trial reported that duration of a onehour instillation of MMC was more effective compared to a 30-minute instillation, but no efficacy comparisons
are available for one- vs. two-hour durations of instillation [293] (LE: 3). Another RCT using epirubicin has
documented that concentration is more important than treatment duration [294] (LE: 1b). In view of these data,
instructions are provided (see Section 7.7).
7.4.2.3.2 Device-assisted intravesical chemotherapy
Hyperthermic intravesical chemotherapy
Different technologies which increase the temperature of instilled MMC are available. A recent systematic
review and meta-analysis including 4 RCTs suggests similar toxicity as for BCG with maintenance schedule [295].
Microwave-induced hyperthermia effect (RITE)
Promising data have been presented on enhancing the efficacy of MMC using microwave-induced
hyperthermia in patients with high-risk tumours [296]. In one RCT comparing one year of BCG with one year
MMC and microwave-induced hyperthermia in patients with intermediate- and high-risk BC, increased RFS at
24 months in the MMC group was demonstrated [297] (LE: 1b).
Conductive chemohyperthermia
In an open-label phase II RCT including 259 patients, HIVEC chemo-hyperthermia failed to demonstrate an
improvement in DFS at 24 months over standard adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy in intermediate-risk
NMIBC (61% vs. 60%), with a higher risk of treatment discontinuation (59% vs. 89% of completed planned
treatments) [298].
In a pilot phase II RCT on 50 high-risk NMIBCs, HIVEC™ MMC showed early outcomes comparable
to BCG (24 months RFS, 86.5% with HIVEC™ and 71.8% with BCG, p = 0.184) [299]. These data needs to be
corroborated by further studies.
Electromotive drug administration
The efficacy of MMC using electromotive drug administration (EMDA) sequentially combined with BCG in
patients with high-risk tumours has been demonstrated in one small RCT [300]. The definitive conclusion,
however, needs further confirmation. For application of device-assisted instillations in patients recurring after
BCG treatment, see Section 7.9.3.

Summary of evidence - intravesical chemotherapy

Summary of evidence
In patients with low-risk NMIBC and in those with a small Ta LG/G1 recurrence detected more than
one year after previous TURB, a SI significantly reduces the recurrence rate compared to TURB alone.
Single instillation might have an impact on recurrence even when further adjuvant chemotherapy
instillations are given.
Repeat chemotherapy instillations (with or without previous SI) improve RFS in intermediate-risk
patients.

Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy
7.4.3.1
Efficacy of BCG
7.4.3.1.1 Recurrence rate
Five meta-analyses have confirmed that BCG after TURB is superior to TURB alone or TURB plus
chemotherapy for preventing the recurrence of NMIBC [282, 301-304] (LE: 1a). Three RCTs of intermediateand high-risk tumours have compared BCG with epirubicin and interferon (INF) [305], MMC [306], or epirubicin
alone [283] and have confirmed the superiority of BCG for prevention of tumour recurrence (LE: 1a). The effect
is long lasting [283, 306] and was also observed in a separate analysis of patients with intermediate-risk
tumours [283]. One meta-analysis [282] has evaluated the individual data from 2,820 patients enrolled in 9
RCTs that have compared MMC vs. BCG. In the trials with BCG maintenance, there was a 32% reduction in the
risk of recurrence for BCG compared to MMC, but a 28% increase in the risk of recurrence for patients treated
with BCG in the trials without BCG maintenance. A Cochrane systematic review confirmed that BCG is more
effective in reducing the recurrence rate over MMC [307].
7.4.3.1.2 Progression rate
Two meta-analyses have demonstrated that BCG therapy delays and potentially lowers the risk of tumour
progression [280, 281, 304] (LE: 1a). A meta-analysis carried out by the EORTC GUCG has evaluated data
from 4,863 patients enrolled in 24 RCTs. In 20 of the trials, some form of BCG maintenance was used. Based
on a median follow-up of 2.5 years, tumours progressed in 9.8% of the patients treated with BCG compared
to 13.8% in the control groups (TURB alone, TURB and intravesical chemotherapy, or TURB with the addition
of other immunotherapy). This shows a reduction of 27% in the odds of progression with BCG maintenance
treatment. The size of the reduction was similar in patients with TaT1 papillary tumours and in those with CIS
[281]. A RCT with long-term follow-up has demonstrated significantly fewer distant metastases and better overalland disease-specific survival in patients treated with BCG compared to epirubicin [283] (LE: 1b). In contrast, an
individual patient data meta-analysis and Cochrane review were not able to confirm any statistically significant
difference between MMC and BCG for progression, survival, and cause of death [282, 307].
The conflicting results in the outcomes of these studies can be explained by different patient
characteristics, duration of follow-up, methodology and statistical power. However, most studies showed a
reduction in the risk of progression in high-and intermediate-risk tumours if a BCG maintenance schedule was
applied.
7.4.3.1.3 Influence of further factors
Two other meta-analyses have suggested a possible bias in favour of BCG arising from the inclusion of patients
previously treated with intravesical chemotherapy [308]. In the individual patient data meta-analysis, however,
BCG maintenance was more effective than MMC in reduction of recurrence rate, both in patients previously
treated and not previously treated with chemotherapy [282] (LE: 1a). It was demonstrated that BCG was less
effective in patients > 70 years of age, but still more effective than epirubicin in a cohort of elderly patients [309]
(LE: 1a). According to a cohort analysis, the risk of tumour recurrence after BCG was shown to be higher in
patients with a previous history of UTUC [310].
7.4.3.2
BCG strain
Although smaller studies without maintenance demonstrated some differences between strains [310-312],
a network meta-analysis identified ten different BCG strains used for intravesical treatment in the published
literature but was not able to confirm superiority of any BCG strain over another [313].
Similarly, a published meta-analysis of prospective RCTs [281], published data from a prospective registry
[314] as well as from a post-hoc analysis of a large phase II prospective trial assessing BCG and INF-α in both
BCG-naive and BCG-failure patients did not suggest any clear difference in efficacy between the different BCG
strains [315] (LE: 2a). The quality of data, however, does not allow definitive conclusions.

28

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

7.4.3.3
BCG toxicity
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin intravesical treatment is associated with more side effects compared to intravesical
chemotherapy [281, 307] (LE: 1a). However, serious side effects are encountered in < 5% of patients and can
be treated effectively in almost all cases [316] (LE: 1b). The incidence of BCG infections after BCG instillations
was 1% in a registry-based cohort analysis [317]. It has been shown that a maintenance schedule is not
associated with an increased risk of side effects compared to an induction course [316]. Side effects requiring
treatment stoppage were seen more often in the first year of therapy [318]. Elderly patients do not seem to
experience more side effects leading to treatment discontinuation [319] (LE: 2a). No significant difference in
toxicity between different BCG strains was demonstrated [314]. Symptoms may be the result of side effects
of the BCG treatment or caused by bladder disease (widespread CIS) itself. Consequently, the burden of
symptoms is reduced after completion of the treatment in a significant number of patients [320].
Major complications can appear after systemic absorption of the drug. Thus, contraindications of BCG
intravesical instillation should be respected (see Section 7.9). The presence of leukocyturia, nonvisible
haematuria or asymptomatic bacteriuria is not a contraindication for BCG application, and antibiotic
prophylaxis is not necessary in these cases [121, 321] (LE: 3). Three RCTs suggest reduced side effects by
administering different quinolones in conjunction with the BCG-instillations [322-324]. The latter, by using two
doses of levofloxacin in conjunction with each BCG-instillation, reduced the proportion of patients with highgrade side effects, both local (pollakisuria) and systemic (fever), and additionally displayed improved PFS in the
experimental arm [324] (LE: 1b).
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin should be used with caution in immunocompromised patients; e.g.,
immunosuppression, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection poses relative contraindications [325],
although some small studies have shown similar efficacy and no increase in complications compared to
non-immunocompromised patients. The role of prophylactic anti-tuberculosis medication in these patients
remains unclear [326-328] (LE: 3). The management of side effects after BCG should reflect their type and
grade according to the recommendations provided by the International Bladder Cancer Group (IBCG) and by a
Spanish group [329, 330] (Table 7.1).

(even in the absence of a positive culture) and thus no restriction applies to the empirical use of quinolones by
the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the EMA (see also Section 3.7 Complicated UTI and
3.7.4.1- Choice of antimicrobials of the EAU Guidelines on Urological Infection 2022) [7, 334].
7.4.3.4
Optimal BCG schedule
Induction BCG instillations are given according to the empirical 6-weekly schedule introduced by Morales
et al., [335]. For optimal efficacy, BCG must be given in a maintenance schedule [280-282, 304] (LE: 1a). Many
different maintenance schedules have been used, ranging from a total of 10 instillations given in 18 to 27 weeks
over 3 years [336].
7.4.3.4.1 Optimal number of induction instillations and frequency of instillations during maintenance
The optimal number of induction instillations and frequency of maintenance instillations were evaluated by
NIMBUS, a prospective phase III RCT. Safety analysis after 345 randomised patients demonstrated that a
reduced number of instillations (3 instillations in induction and 2 instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months) proved
inferior to the standard schedule (6 instillation in induction and 3 instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months) regarding
the time to first recurrence [337] (LE: 1b). In a RCT including 397 patients CUETO showed that in high-risk
tumours a maintenance schedule with only one instillation every 3 months for 3 years was not superior to
induction therapy only, which suggested that one instillation may be suboptimal to 3 instillations in each
maintenance cycle [338] (LE: 1b).
7.4.3.4.2 Optimal length of maintenance
In their meta-analysis, Böhle et al., concluded that at least one year of maintenance BCG is required to obtain
superiority of BCG over MMC for prevention of recurrence or progression [280] (LE: 1a).
In a RCT of 1,355 patients, the EORTC has shown that when BCG is given at full dose, 3 years’
maintenance (3-weekly instillations 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months) reduces the recurrence rate compared
to one year in high- but not in intermediate-risk patients. There were no differences in progression or OS. In the
3-year arm, however, 36.1% of patients did not complete the 3-year schedule [339] (LE: 1b). The main reason
why these patients stopped treatment was treatment inefficacy, not toxicity.
7.4.3.5
Optimal dose of BCG
To reduce BCG toxicity, instillation of a reduced dose was proposed. However, it has been suggested that a full
dose of BCG is more effective in multifocal tumours [340, 341] (LE: 1b). The CUETO study compared one-third
dose to full-dose BCG and found no overall difference in efficacy. One-third of the standard dose of BCG might
be the minimum effective dose for intermediate-risk tumours. A further reduction to one-sixth dose resulted in a

30

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

decrease in efficacy with no decrease in toxicity [342] (LE: 1b). The EORTC did not find any difference in toxicity
between one-third and full-dose BCG, but one-third dose BCG was associated with a higher recurrence rate,
especially when it was given only for one year [318, 339] (LE: 1b). In a recent meta-analysis of 9 RCTs, patients
who received less than half of the standard BCG dose experienced less adverse events as compared to
patients receiving the full dose, but suffered more recurrences [343].

Summary of evidence - BCG treatment

Summary of evidence
In patients with intermediate- and high-risk tumours, intravesical BCG after TURB reduces the risk of
tumour recurrence; it is more effective than TURB alone or TURB and intravesical chemotherapy.
For optimal efficacy, BCG must be given in a maintenance schedule.
Three-year maintenance is more effective than one year to prevent recurrence in patients with highrisk tumours, but not in patients with intermediate-risk tumours.

Combination therapy
7.4.4.1
Intravesical BCG plus chemotherapy versus BCG alone
In one RCT, a combination of MMC and BCG was shown to be more effective in reducing the risk of disease
recurrence while increasing toxicity compared to BCG monotherapy (LE: 1b). Using similar BCG schedules in
both groups, each BCG instillation in the combination group was preceded a day before by an added MMC
instillation [344]. In a RCT using MMC with EMDA, a combination of BCG and MMC with EMDA showed an
improved recurrence-free interval and reduced progression rate compared to BCG monotherapy [300, 345] (LE:
2). Two meta-analyses demonstrated improved disease-free survival (DFS), but no benefit in PFS in patients
treated with combination treatment comparing to BCG monotherapy [345, 346].
7.4.4.2
Combination treatment using interferon
In a Cochrane meta-analysis of 4 RCTs, a combination of BCG and IFN-2α did not show a clear difference
in recurrence and progression over BCG alone [347]. In one study, weekly MMC followed by monthly BCG
alternating with IFN-2α showed a higher probability of recurrence compared to MMC followed by BCG alone
[348]. Additionally, a RCT in a similar population of NMIBC comparing BCG monotherapy with a combination
of epirubicin and INF for up to two years showed the latter was significantly inferior to BCG monotherapy in
preventing recurrence [349] (LE: 1b).
7.4.4.3
Sequential chemotherapy instillations
Preclinical data suggest that the efficacy of intravesical chemotherapy instillations can be improved by
combinations compared to the administration of single agents only [350]. Sequential (immediate) instillations
of gemcitabine and docetaxel was initially reported in 2015 in the wake of BCG-shortage but also at times
of limited access to mitomycin [351]. Subsequently other sequential chemotherapy combinations such
as valrubicin and docetaxel have been suggested [352]. Over time, additional retrospective data have
accumulated where sequential gemcitabine and docetaxel instillations were used in patients recurring after
induction BCG and BCG-unresponsive disease [353]; in patients with recurrence after BCG-induction but not
fulfilling the criteria for BCG-unresponsive disease [354]; and also in BCG-naïve high-risk patients [355]. Thus,
in patients with BCG-unresponsive disease when the treatment standard (radical cystectomy) is not feasible
due to age and/or comorbidity or when patients are unwilling to accept radical surgery, sequential instillations
with gemcitabine and docetaxel is an emerging treatment concept awaiting further prospective scientific
evaluation.
7.4.5
Specific aspects of treatment of carcinoma in situ
7.4.5.1
Treatment strategy
The detection of concurrent CIS increases the risk of recurrence and progression of TaT1 tumours [222, 224]. In
this case further treatment according to the criteria summarised in Sections 7.4.2, 7.4.3 and 7.9 is mandatory.
Carcinoma in situ cannot be cured by an endoscopic procedure alone. Histological diagnosis of CIS must be
followed by further treatment, either intravesical BCG instillations or RC (LE: 4). Tumour-specific survival rates
after immediate RC for CIS are excellent, but a large proportion of patients might be over-treated [232] (LE: 3).

7.4.5.2
Cohort studies on intravesical BCG or chemotherapy
In retrospective evaluations of patients with CIS, a complete response rate of 48% was achieved with
intravesical chemotherapy and 72−93% with BCG [232-235, 356] (LE: 2a). Up to 50% of complete responders
might eventually show recurrence with a risk of invasion and/or extravesical recurrence [235, 273, 336, 356]
(LE: 3).
7.4.5.3
Prospective randomised trials on intravesical BCG or chemotherapy
Unfortunately, there have been few RCTs in patients with CIS only. A meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing
intravesical BCG to intravesical chemotherapy in patients with CIS has shown a significantly increased
response rate after BCG and a reduction of 59% in the odds of treatment failure with BCG [357] (LE: 1a).
In an EORTC-GUCG meta-analysis of tumour progression, in a subgroup of 403 patients with CIS,
BCG reduced the risk of progression by 35% as compared to intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy
[281] (LE: 1b). The combination of BCG and MMC was not superior to BCG alone [358]. In summary, compared
to chemotherapy, BCG treatment of CIS increases the complete response rate, the overall percentage of
patients who remain disease free, and reduces the risk of tumour progression (LE: 1b).
7.4.5.4
Treatment of CIS in the prostatic urethra and upper urinary tract
Patients with CIS are at high risk of extravesical involvement in the UUT and in the prostatic urethra. Solsona
et al., found that 63% of 138 patients with CIS developed extravesical involvement initially or during follow-up
[359]. Patients with extravesical involvement had worse survival than those with bladder CIS alone [359] (LE: 3).
In the prostate, CIS might be present only in the epithelial lining of the prostatic urethra or in the prostatic ducts
[360]. These situations should be distinguished from tumour invasion into the prostatic stroma (stage T4a in
bladder tumours) and for which immediate radical cystoprostatectomy is mandatory. Patients with CIS in the
epithelial lining of the prostatic urethra can be treated by intravesical instillation of BCG. Transurethral resection
of the prostate can improve contact of BCG with the prostatic urethra [146, 361] (LE: 3). However, potential
spread of CIS has to be considered; no suprapubic trocar-placed catheter should be used.
In patients with prostatic duct involvement there are promising results of BCG, but only from small
series. The data are insufficient to provide clear treatment recommendations and radical surgery should be
considered [361, 362] (LE: 3).
7.4.5.5

Summary of evidence - treatment of carcinoma in situ

Summary of evidence
Carcinoma in situ cannot be cured by an endoscopic procedure alone.
Compared to intravesical chemotherapy, intravesical BCG maintenance instillations increase the
complete response rate, the overall percentage of patients who remain disease free, and reduce the
risk of tumour progression.

Intravesical chemoablation and neoadjuvant treatment

Older marker lesion studies have shown that chemoablation with a single intravesical chemotherapy instillation
can achieve a complete response in a proportion of patients [363]. In addition, hypothesis-generating findings
from an older RCT comparing immediate pre-operative device-assisted (EMDA) MMC with post-operative
SI with MMC and TURB only, showed improved long-term RFS among patients treated prior to TURB [364],
and thus even suggest a long-term effect after neoadjuvant instillations. While this has not been reproduced
by other groups, additional neoadjuvant clinical trials were recently published. In recurrent low-risk [365] and
recurrent Ta tumours [366], 4 and 6 intravesical MMC instillations achieved complete response in 37% and
57% of the patients, respectively. The former study prematurely stopped recruitment as the anticipated 45%
complete response after chemoablation was not achieved. Compared to TURB, less dysuria and incontinence
occurred in the intervention arm of the trial. Before routine clinical application, additional high-level evidence
with RFS as an outcome measure is required.

7.6

Radical cystectomy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer

There are several reasons to consider immediate RC for selected patients with NMIBC:
•
The staging accuracy for T1 tumours by TURB is low with 27–51% of patients being upstaged to muscleinvasive tumour at RC [182, 367-371] (LE: 3).
•
Some patients with NMIBC experience disease progression to muscle-invasive disease (Table 6.2).
•
Patients who experience disease progression to muscle-invasive stage have a worse prognosis than
those who present with ‘primary’ muscle-invasive disease [372, 373].

32

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

The potential benefit of RC must be weighed against its risks, morbidity, and impact on quality of life (QoL) and
discussed with patients, in a shared decision-making process. It is reasonable to propose immediate RC in
those patients with NMIBC who are at very high risk of disease progression (see Section 6.3 and Tables 6.1 and 6.2)
[75, 179, 222, 224, 374] (LE: 3).
Early RC is strongly recommended in patients with BCG-unresponsive tumours and should be
considered in BCG relapsing HG tumours as mentioned in Section 7.9 and Table 7.3. A delay in RC may lead to
decreased disease-specific survival [375] (LE: 3).
In patients in whom RC is performed before progression to MIBC, the 5-year DFS rate exceeds 80%
[376-378] (LE: 3).

7.7

Primary treatment by disease type

The type of further therapy after TURB should be based on the risk groups shown in Section 6.3 and Table 6.1.
The stratification and treatment recommendations are based on the risk of disease progression. In particular
in intermediate-risk tumours, the 2006 EORTC scoring model may be used (Section 6.1.1.1) to determine a
patient’s individual risk of disease recurrence as the basis to decide further treatment on.
•

Treatment of low-risk disease
Patients in the low-risk group have a negligible risk of disease progression. The single post-operative
instillation of chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence and is considered as sufficient treatment in
these patients.

•

Treatment of intermediate-risk disease
Patients in the intermediate-risk group have a low risk of disease progression (7.4 and 8.5% after 10
years according to the 2021 EAU NMIBC scoring model). In these patients one-year full-dose BCG
treatment (induction plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), or instillations of chemotherapy
(the optimal schedule is not known) for a maximum of one year, is recommended. The final choice should
reflect the individual patient’s risk of recurrence and progression as well as the efficacy and side effects of
each treatment modality.

•

Treatment of high-risk disease
Patients in the high-risk group have a high risk of disease progression (14.1 and 14.2% after 10 years
according to the 2021 EAU NMIBC scoring model). In these patients full-dose intravesical BCG for one
to 3 years (induction plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months), is indicated. The
additional beneficial effect of the second and third years of maintenance should be weighed against
its added costs, side effects and problems associated with BCG shortage. Because of the high risk of
progression, immediate RC may also be discussed with the patient. Radical cystectomy is the safest
approach from an oncological point of view, it is, however, associated with the risk of complications and
QoL impairment and represents over-treatment in some patients.

•

Treatment of very high-risk disease
Patients in the very high-risk group have an extremely high risk of tumour progression (53.1 and 58.6%
after 10 years according to the 2021 EAU NMIBC scoring model). Immediate RC should be discussed
with these patients. In case RC is not feasible or refused by the patient, full-dose intravesical BCG for one
to 3 years should be offered.

•

Treatment of carcinoma in situ
Patients with carcinoma in situ cannot be managed by an endoscopic procedure alone and should be
offered either intravesical BCG instillations or RC (LE: 4). BCG treatment of CIS increases the complete
response rate, the overall percentage of patients who remain disease free, and reduces the risk of tumour
progression (LE: 1b). In comparison, immediate RC for CIS results in excellent tumour-specific survival
rates although a large proportion of patients might be over-treated [232] (LE: 3).

7.8

Multidisciplinary tumour board

A multidisciplinary tumour board (MDT) approach including reassessment of radiology and pathology is
associated with a changed treatment plan in up to 44% of BC patients [379], such as refraining from or
recommending cystectomy in 7% of stage T1 patients [380-382], often as a result of the pathologic review
[70, 381]. Thus, patients with high-risk and very high-risk NMIBC will especially benefit from MDT discussion
and such an approach is recommended for these patients.
Figure 7.1 presents a treatment flow chart based on risk category, which may guide management of an
individual patient.

7.9

Treatment of failure of intravesical therapy

7.9.1
Recurrence during or after intravesical chemotherapy
Patients with NMIBC recurrence during or after a chemotherapy regimen can benefit from BCG instillations.
Prior intravesical chemotherapy has no impact on the effect of BCG instillations [282] (LE: 1a).
7.9.2
Treatment failure after intravesical BCG immunotherapy
Several categories of BCG failures, broadly defined as any HG disease occurring during or after BCG therapy,
have been proposed (see Table 7.2). Non-muscle-invasive BC may not respond at all (BCG refractory) or may
relapse after initial response (BCG relapsing). Some evidence suggests that patients with BCG relapse have
better outcomes than BCG refractory patients [383].
To be able to specify the subgroup of patients where additional BCG is unlikely to provide benefit, the
category of BCG-unresponsive tumour was defined. Further BCG instillations in these patients are associated
with an increased risk of progression [236, 384]. The category of BCG-unresponsive tumours comprises
BCG-refractory and some of BCG-relapsing tumours (see Table 7.2) [385]. The definition was developed in
consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in particular to promote single-arm trials to
provide primary evidence of effectiveness in this setting [386]. Non-HG recurrence after BCG is not considered
as BCG failure.
Table 7.2: Categories of high-grade recurrence during or after BCG
Whenever a MIBC is detected during follow-up.
BCG-refractory tumour
1. If T1 HG/G3 tumour is present at 3 months [236, 384, 387] (LE: 3).
2. If Ta HG/G3 tumour is present after 3 months and/or at 6 months, after either re-induction or first course of
maintenance [360] (LE: 4).
3. If CIS (without concomitant papillary tumour) is present at 3 months and persists at 6 months after either
re-induction or first course of maintenance. If patients with CIS present at 3 months, an additional BCG
course can achieve a complete response in > 50% of cases [67, 356, 360] (LE: 1b).
4. If HG tumour appears during BCG maintenance therapy*.
BCG-relapsing tumour
Recurrence of HG/G3) tumour after completion of BCG maintenance, despite an initial response [388] (LE: 3).
BCG-unresponsive tumour
BCG-unresponsive tumours include all BCG refractory tumours and those who develop T1/Ta HG recurrence
within 6 months of completion of adequate BCG exposure** or develop CIS within 12 months of completion
of adequate BCG exposure [385] (LE: 4).
BCG intolerance
Severe side effects that prevent further BCG instillation before completing treatment [330].
* Patients with LG recurrence during or after BCG treatment are not considered to be a BCG failure.
** Adequate BCG is defined as the completion of at least 5 of 6 doses of an initial induction course plus at least
2 out of 6 doses of a second induction course or 2 out of 3 doses of maintenance therapy.
Treatment of BCG-unresponsive tumours, late BCG-relapsing tumours, LG recurrences after
BCG treatment and patients with BCG intolerance
Patients with BCG-unresponsive disease are unlikely to respond to further BCG therapy; RC is therefore the
standard and preferred option. Currently, several bladder preservation strategies are being investigated such as
cytotoxic intravesical therapies [389-392], device assisted instillations [393-395], intravesical immunotherapy
[396, 397], systemic immunotherapy [398] or gene therapy [399-401].
7.9.3

A phase III RCT including predominantly high-risk NMIBC patients failing at least a previous induction
course of BCG, MMC combined with microwave-induced hyperthermia provided 35% overall DFS at 2 years
as compared to 41% in the control arm (treated with either BCG, MMC or MMC and electromotive drug
administration at the discretion of the investigator). In the pre-planned sub-analysis, MMC and microwaveinduced thermotherapy showed lower response rates in CIS recurrences but higher DFS in non-CIS papillary
tumours (53% vs. 24%) [395].

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

35

Promising data on BCG-unresponsive cohorts of patients with CIS alone or concomitant to papillary tumours
were recently reported following new immunotherapies. Systemic pembrolizumab achieved a 40% complete
response rate in a prospective phase II study which was maintained in 48% of patients for up to 12 months
(n = 101), resulting in FDA approval of the study drug for this patient population [402]. Promising data from a
phase III multicentre RCT with intravesical nadofaragene firadenovec showed a complete response in 53.4%
of patients with BCG-unresponsive CIS [403]. A secondary analysis indicates that a combination of posttreatment titres of serum anti–human adenovirus type-5 antibody and fold change from baseline can predict
treatment efficacy [404].
A systematic review and meta-analysis including 4 RCTs and 24 single-arm studies (all currently available
prospective studies) assessed bladder-sparing treatments following BCG failure [405]. The significant
heterogeneity of both trial designs and patient characteristics included in these studies, the different definitions
of BCG failures used, and missing information on prior BCG courses may account for the variability in efficacy
for the different compounds assessed across different trials. A higher number of previous BCG courses, BCG
refractory/unresponsive or CIS predicted lower response rates. The pooled 12-month response rates were
24% for trials with > 2 prior BCG courses and 36% for those with > 1 BCG courses. Initial response rate did
not predict durable responses highlighting the need for longer-term follow-up. More recently, a systematic
review assessing 42 prospective trials on bladder-preserving treatments after BCG showed that patients
with papillary-only recurrences appeared more effectively treated (median recurrence free rate of 44% at
1 year, median progression-free rate of 89% at a median follow-up of 19 months) than CIS-containing tumours
(median complete response rate of 17% at 1 year with a median progression-free rate of 95% at a median
follow-up of 12 months), highlighting potential biological differences between these two tumour entities which
should be analysed separately when reporting results of clinical trials [406].
At the present time, treatments other than RC are considered oncologically inferior in patients with BCGunresponsive disease [236, 384, 387] (LE: 3). Various studies suggest that repeat-BCG therapy is appropriate
for non-HG and even for some HG recurrent tumours; namely those relapsing beyond one year after BCG
exposure (cases which do not meet the criteria of BCG-unresponsive disease) [407, 408] (LE: 3).
Treatment decisions in LG recurrences after BCG (which are not considered as any category of BCG failure)
should be individualised according to tumour characteristics. Little is known about the optimal treatment in
patients with high-risk tumours who could not complete BCG instillations because of intolerance.

Guidelines for adjuvant therapy in TaT1 tumours and for therapy of carcinoma in situ

General recommendations
Counsel smokers to stop smoking.
The type of further therapy after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) should
be based on the risk groups shown in Section 6.3 and Table 6.1. For determination of a
patient’s risk group use the 2021 EAU risk group calculator available at www.nmibc.net.
In patients with tumours presumed to be at low risk and in those with small papillary
recurrences (presumably Ta LG/G1) detected more than one year after previous TURB, offer
one immediate single chemotherapy instillation.
Offer post-operative saline or water continuous irrigation of the bladder to patients who
cannot receive a single instillation of chemotherapy.

Patients with small recurrent low-grade Ta tumours can be effectively and safely offered
office fulguration.
Only offer active surveillance to selected patients with presumed low-risk tumours not
amendable to endoscopic ablation.
In patients with intermediate-risk tumours (with or without immediate instillation), offer
one-year full-dose Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment (induction plus 3-weekly
instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), or instillations of chemotherapy (the optimal schedule
is not known) for a maximum of one year. The final choice should be made in a shared
decision-making process with the patient, reflecting his/her risk of recurrence and
progression, as well as the efficacy and side effects of each treatment modality.
In patients with high-risk tumours, full-dose intravesical BCG for one to 3 years (induction
plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months), is indicated. The additional
beneficial effect of the second and third years of maintenance should be weighed against its
added costs, side effects and access to BCG. Immediate radical cystectomy (RC) may also
be discussed with the patient.
In patients with very high-risk tumours offer immediate RC. Discuss intravesical full-dose
BCG instillations for one to 3 years and discuss clinical trials with those who refuse or are
unfit for RC.
Offer transurethral resection of the prostate, followed by intravesical instillation of BCG to
patients with CIS in the epithelial lining of the prostatic urethra.
Cautiously offer quinolones to treat BCG-related side effects*.
The definition of ‘BCG-unresponsive’ should be respected as it most precisely defines the
patients who are unlikely to respond to further BCG instillations.
Offer a RC to patients with BCG-unresponsive tumours.
Offer patients with BCG-unresponsive tumours, who are not candidates for RC due
to comorbidities, preservation strategies (intravesical chemotherapy, chemotherapy
and microwave-induced hyperthermia, electromotive administration of chemotherapy,
intravesical- or systemic immunotherapy; preferably within clinical trials).
Discuss high-risk and very high-risk patients within a multidisciplinary board, when possible.
Recommendations - technical aspects for treatment
Intravesical chemotherapy
If given, administer a single immediate instillation of chemotherapy within 24 hours after TURB.
Omit a single immediate instillation of chemotherapy in any case of overt or suspected
bladder perforation or bleeding requiring bladder irrigation.
The optimal schedule and duration of further intravesical chemotherapy instillation is not
defined; however, it should not exceed one year.
If intravesical chemotherapy is given, use the drug at its optimal pH and maintain the
concentration of the drug by reducing fluid intake before and during instillation.
The length of individual instillation should be a minimum of one, and up to two hours.
BCG intravesical immunotherapy
Absolute contraindications of BCG intravesical instillation are:
• during the first two weeks after TURB;
• in patients with visible haematuria;
• after traumatic catheterisation;
• in patients with symptomatic urinary tract infection.

EAU Risk Group: Intermediate
In all patients either one-year full-dose Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment (induction Strong
plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), or instillations of chemotherapy (the optimal
schedule is not known) for a maximum of one year is recommended. The final choice should
reflect the individual patient’s risk of recurrence and progression as well as the efficacy and
side effects of each treatment modality. Offer one immediate chemotherapy instillation to
patients with small papillary recurrences detected more than one year after previous TURB.
EAU risk group: High
Offer intravesical full-dose BCG instillations for one to 3 years but discuss immediate radical Strong
cystectomy (RC).
EAU risk group: Very High
Offer RC or intravesical full-dose BCG instillations for one to 3 years to those who refuse or Strong
are unfit for RC.

FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS WITH NMIBC

As a result of the risk of recurrence and progression, patients with NMIBC need surveillance following therapy.
However, the frequency and duration of cystoscopy and imaging follow-up should reflect the individual
patient’s degree of risk. Using the EAU NMIBC prognostic factor risk groups (see Section 6.3, Tables 6.1
and 6.2) or further prognostic models for specific patient populations (see Chapter 6), the short- and longterm risks of recurrence and progression in individual patients may be predicted and the follow-up schedule
adapted accordingly (see Section 8.1) [222, 224]. However, recommendations for follow-up are mainly based
on retrospective data and there is a lack of RCTs investigating the possibility of safely reducing the frequency
of follow-up cystoscopy.
When planning the follow-up schedule and methods, the following aspects should be considered:
•
The prompt detection of muscle-invasive and HG/G3 non-muscle-invasive recurrence is crucial and the
percentage of tumours missed should be as low as possible because a delay in diagnosis and therapy
can be life-threatening. Therefore, the best surveillance strategy for these patients will continue to include
frequent cystoscopy and cytology.
•
Tumour recurrence in the low-risk group is nearly always low stage and LG/G1. Small, Ta LG/G1 papillary
recurrence does not present an immediate danger to the patient and early detection is not essential for
successful therapy [250, 409] (LE: 2b). Fulguration of small papillary recurrences on an outpatient basis
could be safe [410] and comparable to conventional TURB (LE: 1b). Multiple authors have suggested
active surveillance in selected cases [411-413] (LE: 3/2a). However, repeated TURBs before entry, as well
as presence of more than one lesion at entry, were signiﬁcantly associated with AS failure [256].
•
The first cystoscopy after TURB at 3 months is an important prognostic indicator for recurrence
and progression [230, 235, 248, 251, 414] (LE: 1a). Therefore, the first cystoscopy should always be
performed 3 months after TURB in all patients with TaT1 tumours and CIS.
•
In tumours at low risk, the risk of recurrence after 5 recurrence-free years is low [251] (LE: 3). Therefore,
in low-risk tumours, after 5 years of follow-up, discontinuation of cystoscopy or its replacement with less
invasive methods can be considered [414].

In tumours originally intermediate-, high risk, or very high risk treated conservatively, recurrences after ten
years tumour-free are not unusual [415] (LE: 3). Therefore, life-long follow-up is recommended [414].
The follow-up strategy must reflect the risk of extravesical recurrence (prostatic urethra in men and UUT
in both genders).
The risk of UUT recurrence increases in patients with multiple- and high-risk tumours [96] (LE: 3).
There may be a role for newer methods of tumour visualisation in follow-up cystoscopy. In two
prospective studies of blue light flexible cystoscopy (BLFC) for surveillance of NMIBC, BLFC allowed
identification of 4 to 5.7 % of recurrences that would have been missed in case of WL cystoscopy alone
[416, 417]. On the other hand, a prospective study of NBI for NMIBC surveillance failed to show any
benefit for NBI over WL cystoscopy alone [418].
The current status of urine cytology and urinary molecular marker tests is discussed in detail in Sections
5.5, 5.6 and 5.7. Non-muscle-invasive BC follow-up strategies include urine cytology and urinary
molecular marker tests as adjunct (or companion) tests to improve detection at the time of flexible
cystoscopy or as replacement tests to reduce the number of flexible cystoscopies.
The role of urinary cytology or urinary molecular markers as an adjunct to cystoscopy (companion test) in
the follow-up of NMIBC has been investigated [118, 119, 131, 132, 142]. One prospective RCT found that
knowledge of positive test results (microsatellite analysis) can improve the quality of follow-up cystoscopy
[143] (LE: 1b), supporting the adjunctive role of a non-invasive urine test performed prior to follow-up
cystoscopy [143] (see Section 5.7.3).
In order to reduce or replace cystoscopy altogether, urinary markers should be able to detect
recurrence in all risk groups. However the previously reported low sensitivity for LG recurrences limits
their utility in this group [113, 118] (LE: 1b) although more recent studies have shown reasonable
sensitivity in low grade recurrences (sensitivity of 40–65% [136, 419] and only a 5.8% risk of missed
recurrences using repeated molecular testing in a cohort of patients undergoing active surveillance for
low-grade NMIBC [420].
In patients initially diagnosed with Ta LG/G1–2 BC, US of the bladder or a urinary marker may be a mode
of surveillance in case cystoscopy is not possible or refused by the patient [139, 142, 421].
According to current knowledge, no urinary marker can replace cystoscopy during follow-up or lower
cystoscopy frequency in a routine fashion. Nonetheless, some urinary markers have shown fairly high
sensitivities to detect tumour recurrence, particularly in HG disease, along with very high NPVs to make
the premises for their future implementation in follow-up [135, 419, 420, 422] (Table 8.1).

Summary of evidence and guidelines for follow-up of patients after transurethral
resection of the bladder for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer

Summary of evidence
LE
The first cystoscopy after transurethral resection of the bladder at 3 months is an important prognostic 1a
indicator for recurrence and progression.
The risk of upper urinary tract recurrence increases in patients with multiple- and high-risk tumours.
3
Recommendations
Base follow-up of TaT1 tumours and carcinoma in situ (CIS) on regular cystoscopy.
Patients with low-risk Ta tumours should undergo cystoscopy at 3 months. If negative,
subsequent cystoscopy is advised 9 months later, and then yearly for 5 years.

NON-MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (TAT1 AND CIS) - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

Patients with high-risk and those with very high-risk tumours treated conservatively should
undergo cystoscopy and urinary cytology at 3 months. If negative, subsequent cystoscopy
and cytology should be repeated every 3 months for a period of 2 years, and every 6
months thereafter until 5 years, and then yearly.
Patients with intermediate-risk Ta tumours should have an in-between (individualised)
follow-up scheme using cystoscopy.
Regular (yearly) upper tract imaging (computed tomography-intravenous urography [CT-IVU]
or IVU) is recommended for high-risk and very high-risk tumours.
Perform endoscopy under anaesthesia and bladder biopsies when office cystoscopy shows
suspicious findings or if urinary cytology is positive.
During follow-up in patients with positive cytology and no visible tumour in the bladder,
mapping biopsies or PDD-guided biopsies (if equipment is available) and investigation of
extravesical locations (CT urography, prostatic urethra biopsy) are recommended.
