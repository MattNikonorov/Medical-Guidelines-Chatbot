adverse features are found post-RP.
• Footnote removed: See Principles of Risk Stratification.
• Footnote removed: Repeat molecular tumor analysis is discouraged.
• Footnote z modified: PSA persistence/recurrence after RP is defined as failure of PSA to fall to undetectable levels (PSA persistence) or undetectable
PSA after RP with a subsequent detectable PSA that increases on 2 or more determinations (PSA recurrence) or that increases to PSA >0.1 ng/mL.
(Also on PROS-9 and PROS-10)
PROS-9
• Monitoring, Initial definitive therapy, 2nd bullet modified: DRE if suspicion of recurrence every year, but may be omitted if PSA undetectable.

Updates in Version 1.2023 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2022 include:
PROS-12
• Page heading has been modified: Systemic Therapy for Castration-Naive Sensitive Prostate Cancer
• M1:
ADT with one of the following, removed: Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 for 6 cycles (category 1)
Added: or ADT with docetaxel and one of the following:
◊ Preferred regimens:
– Abiraterone (category 1)
– Darolutamide (category 1)
Modified: or ADT with EBRT to the primary tumor for low-volume metastatic burden M1
• 3rd bullet modified: Consider periodic imaging Conventional imaging every 3–6 mo to monitor treatment response.
PROS-12A
• Footnote rr modified: The term "castration-naive sensitive" is used to define patients who have not been treated with ADT and those who are not
on ADT at the time of progression. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel uses the term "castration-naÏve sensitive" even when patients have had
neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant ADT as part of radiation therapy provided they have recovered testicular function.
• Footnote zz modified: Routine use of bone antiresorptive therapy is not recommended in the castration-naïve setting unless for elevated fracture risk
Bone antiresorptive therapy is indicated for elevated fracture risk based upon FRAX in the castration-sensitive setting. See PROS-I.
• Footnote removed: High-volume disease is differentiated from low-volume disease by visceral metastases and/or 4 or more bone metastases, with
at least one metastasis beyond the pelvis vertebral column. Patients with low-volume disease have less certain benefit from early treatment with
docetaxel combined with ADT.
• Footnote aaa added: The panel encourages ADT with docetaxel and either darolutamide or abiraterone for patients with high-volume disease who are
fit for chemotherapy. See Principles of Non-Hormonal Systemic Therapy (PROS-J).
• Footnote bbb added: EBRT to the primary tumor is associated with an overall survival benefit in patients with low metastatic burden at the time of
diagnosis of metastatic disease, which is defined by conventional imaging as either non-regional, lymph-node-only disease OR <4 bone metastases
and without visceral/other metastasis (Ali A, et al. JAMA Oncol 2021;7:555-563). See Principles of Radiation Therapy (PROS-G).
• Footnote ccc added: ADT is strongly recommended in combination therapy for metastatic castration-sensitive disease. The use of ADT monotherapy in
metastatic castration-sensitive disease is discouraged unless there are clear contraindications to combination therapy.
• Footnote removed: See Principles of Non-Hormonal Systemic Therapy.
• Footnote ddd modified: Patients who were under monitoring for M0 disease should receive an appropriate therapy for castration-naive sensitive
disease.
PROS-13
• Footnote removed: Observation involves monitoring the course of disease with the expectation to deliver palliative therapy for the development of
symptoms or a change in exam or PSA that suggests symptoms are imminent.
PROS-14
• First-line and subsequent treatment options:
1st bullet, 5th sub-bullet added: For additional options, See NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer.
• Footnote removed: For additional small cell/NEPC therapy options, see NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer

Updates in Version 1.2023 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2022 include:
PROS-15
• Prior novel hormonal therapy/no prior docetaxel:
Preferred regimens, removed: Sipuleucel-T
Useful in certain circumstances:
◊ Removed: Pembrolizumab for MSI-H, dMMR, or TMB ≥10 mut/Mb
◊ Added: Sipuleucel-T
• Prior docetaxel/no prior novel hormone therapy:
Useful in certain circumstances:
◊ Removed: Pembrolizumab for MSI-H, dMMR, or TMB ≥10 mut/Mb
◊ Added: Sipuleucel-T
Other recommended regimens, removed: Sipuleucel-T
PROS-15A
• Footnote mmm modified: Novel hormone therapies include abiraterone, enzalutamide, darolutamide, or apalutamide received for metastatic castrationnaÏve sensitive disease, M0 CRPC, or previous lines of therapy for M1 CRPC. Abiraterone given as part of neoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant ADT with
EBRT is not considered prior novel hormonal therapy.
• Footnote ttt modified: Olaparib is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in a homologous
recombination repair gene (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or
RAD54L) who have been treated previously with androgen receptor-directed therapy. However, efficacy appears to be driven by the cohort of patients
with at least one alteration in BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM, and in particular, by patients with BRCA2 or BRCA1 mutations based on exploratory geneby-gene analysis. Patients with PPP2R2A mutations in the PROfound trial experienced an unfavorable risk-benefit profile. Therefore, olaparib is not
recommended in patients with a PPP2R2A mutation. There may be heterogeneity of response to olaparib for non-BRCA mutations based on which
gene has a the specific gene mutation.
PROS-B
• A new section has been added to the guidelines: Principles of Quality-of-Life and Shared Decision-Making
PROS-C 1 of 3
• Testing, 1st sub-bullet modified: If criteria are met (see PROS-C, 2 of 3), germline multigene testing that includes at least BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM,
PALB2, CHEK2, HOXB13, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is recommended.
PROS-C 2 of 3
• By family history and/or ancestry,
1st bullet, 3rd sub-bullet modified: male (sex assigned at birth) breast cancer at any age.
2nd bullet modified: ≥1 first-degree relative (father parent or brother sibling) with:
PROS-C 3 of 3
• Testing, 2nd sub-bullet modified: Tumor testing for microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) is recommended in
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and may be considered in patients with regional or castration-naÏve sensitive metastatic
prostate cancer.
• Post-test Considerations, 1st sub-bullet modified: Post-test genetic counseling is recommended if pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant (mutation)
identified in any gene that has clinical implications if also identified in germline (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, HOXB13, MLH1, MSH2,
MSH6, PMS2).

Updates in Version 1.2023 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2022 include:
PROS-D
• This section has been extensively revised.
PROS-E 3 of 3
• Positron Emission Tomography, 2nd bullet modified: F-18 piflufolastat PSMA or Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered as an
alternative to standard imaging of bone and soft tissue for initial staging, the detection of biochemically recurrent disease, and as workup for
progression. with bone scan plus CT or MRI for the evaluation of bone, pelvis, and abdomen.
• Positron Emission Tomography, 8th bullet added: PSMA imaging should be done before initiation of ADT because ADT may affect detection sensitivity.
PROS-F 1 of 5
• Candidacy for Active Surveillance, 2nd bullet modified: Active surveillance is preferred for most patients with low-risk prostate cancer (See Risk Group
Criteria [PROS-2]) and a life expectancy ≥10 years. The panel recognizes that there is heterogeneity across this risk group, and that some factors
may be associated with an increased probability of near-term grade reclassification including high PSA density, a high number of positive cores (eg,
≥3), and high genomic risk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis), and/or a known BRCA2 germline mutation…
PROS-F 2 of 5
• Active Surveillance Program, 1st bullet, 4th sub-bullet modified: Consider repeat mpMRI no more often than every 12 months unless clinically
indicated.
PROS-F 3 of 5
• Observation, 3rd bullet modified: Observation may be considered for is preferred for: Asymptomatic patients with favorable and unfavorable
intermediate-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy between 5–10 years.
PROS-F 5 of 5
• Reference removed: Carter HB, Helfand B, Mamawala M, et al. Germline mutations in ATM and BRCA1/2 are associated with grade reclassification in
men on active surveillance for prostate cancer. Eur Urol 2019;75:743-749.
PROS-G 2 of 7
• Definitive Radiation Therapy by Risk Group
6th bullet, 1st sub-bullet modified: Nodal radiation should be performed. Clinically positive nodes should be dose-escalated as dose-volume
histogram parameters allow. ADT is required unless medically contraindicated, and the addition of abiraterone or fine-particle abiraterone (category
2B) to ADT can be considered is preferred.
7th bullet modified: Low-volume metastatic burden, castration-naive sensitive disease
◊ 1st sub-bullet modified: Radiation therapy to the prostate is an option in patients with low-volume metastatic burden castration-naÏve sensitive
metastatic disease, without contraindications to radiotherapy. ADT is required unless medically contraindicated.
8th bullet and subsequent bullets added: Low metastatic burden is defined as either non-regional, lymph-node-only disease OR <4 bone metastases
and without visceral/other metastasis.
◊ Number and location of lesions is defined by conventional imaging.
◊ At this time, metastases defined only by PET imaging should not be used to exclude a patient from treatment of the primary tumor.
9th bullet modified: This recommendation is based on the STAMPEDE phase 3 randomized trial, which randomized 2061 patients to standard
systemic therapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary. The overall cohort had a significant improvement from the addition of radiotherapy to
the primary in failure-free survival, but not overall survival. The prespecified low-volume subset had a significant improvement in both failure-free
survival and overall survival. A meta-analysis with two other studies confirmed this benefit for primary RT to the primary tumor in lower volume
disease.

Discussion

Updates in Version 1.2023 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2022 include:
PROS-G 3 of 7
• Principles of Radiation Therapy, 1st bullet added: STAMPEDE Arm H has now distinguished the CHAARTED definition of low metastatic disease
to one that more granularly quantifies who benefits from treatment of the primary based on number of bone metastases. This is relevant because a
patient can have 12 spine metastases and be classified as low volume by CHAARTED, but would not derive benefit in overall survival or failure-free
survival when quantifying number of bone metastases. Thus, the number of bone metastases may be preferred to define candidacy for treatment of
the primary tumor.
• Footnote a added: Micro-boost to MRI-dominant disease improved biochemical control in patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer
in a randomized phase III study in the setting of conventionally fractionated EBRT. If using micro-boost, it is critical to restrict dose to OARs to meet
constraints that would normally have been achieved without such boost, sacrificing dose coverage of the boost as needed. Further, careful IGRT and
delivery procedures should be developed in line with the technical demands of this approach.

Updates in Version 1.2023 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2022 include:
PROS-G 7 of 7
• Palliative Radiotherapy, 3rd bullet modified: 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions may be used as alternative palliative
dosing depending on clinical scenario (both category 2B).
PROS-H 1 of 2
• Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection:
Bullet removed: A PLND can be excluded in patients with <2% predicated probability of nodal metastases by nomograms, although some patients
with lymph node metastases will be missed.
4th bullet added: While PLND at the time of RP has not been shown to improve oncologic outcomes, it can provide staging and prognostic
information.
5th bullet added: A PLND can be excluded in patients with low predicated probability of nodal metastases by nomograms, although some patients
with lymph node metastases will be missed. There is no single evidence-based threshold for performing PLND. Based on the risk of complications
with PLND and extra time to perform the procedure, the published thresholds range from 2% to 7%.
6th bullet added: A patient who is above the threshold for performing a PLND, but has a negative PSMA PET scan should still undergo PLND. In two
studies, the sensitivity of PSMA PET for pelvic lymph node involvement among patients undergoing RP and PLND was low (about 40%), and the
negative predictive value was about 81%.Thus, basing the decision to perform PLND on a negative PSMA PET scan could result in missing 19% of
patients with positive lymph nodes.
• Radical Prostatectomy:
3rd bullet modified: Blood loss can be substantial with RP, but can be reduced by using laparoscopic or robotic assistance or by careful control of the
dorsal vein complex and periprostatic vessels when performed as open surgery.
PROS-H 2 of 2
• References have been updated.
PROS-I 1 of 5
• ADT for Clinically Localized (N0,M0) Disease
3rd bullet, 1st sub-bullet, 1st tertiary bullet modified: Goserelin, histrelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin
3rd bullet, sub-bullet removed: LHRH agonist, LHRH agonist plus first-generation antiandrogen, or degarelix with docetaxel (very high risk only)
• ADT for Regional (N1, M0) Disease:
3rd bullet, 2nd sub-bullet, 1st tertiary bullet modified: Goserelin, histrelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin

PROS-I 2 of 5
• Heading modified: ADT for M0 PSA Persistence/Recurrence After RP or EBRT (ADT for M0 Castration-NaÏve Sensitive Disease)
• 7th bullet, 1st sub-bullet, 2nd tertiary bullet added: EBRT + LHRH agonist or degarelix with abiraterone (studies positive for pelvic recurrence only)
• 7th bullet, 2nd sub-bullet modified: M0 radiation therapy recurrence, TRUS biopsy negative or M0 PSA recurrence after progression on salvage EBRT
7th bullet, 2nd sub-bullet, 2nd tertiary bullet, 1st quaternary bullet modified: Goserelin, histrelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin
8th bullet added: Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid [see ADT for Regional (N1,M0) Disease].
• Heading modified: ADT for Metastatic Castration-NaÏve Sensitive Disease
2nd bullet modified: Treatment options for patients with M1 castration-naÏve sensitive disease are:
◊ 1st sub-bullet, 2 subsequent bullets added:
– LHRH agonists: Goserelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin
– First-generation antiandrogens: Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide
◊ The following sub-bullets have been removed:
– Orchiectomy plus docetaxel
– LHRH agonist alone plus docetaxel
▪ Goserelin, histrelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin
▪ A first-generation antiandrogen must be given with LHRH agonist for ≥7 days to prevent testosterone flare if metastases are present in weightbearing bone
– LHRH agonist (as above) plus first-generation antiandrogen plus docetaxel
▪ Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide
– Degarelix plus docetaxel
◊ The following sub-bullets have been added:
– Orchiectomy plus docetaxel and abiraterone or darolutamide
– LHRH agonist (as above) plus docetaxel and abiraterone or darolutamide
– Degarelix plus docetaxel and abiraterone or darolutamide
PROS-I 3 of 5
• 1st bullet modified: When EBRT to primary is given with ADT in low-volume metastatic burden M1, the options are LHRH agonist, LHRH antagonist,
and orchiectomy.
• 2nd bullet modified: Two randomized phase 3 clinical trials of abiraterone with prednisone plus ADT in patients with castration-naÏve sensitive
metastatic prostate cancer...
• 3rd bullet modified: A double-blind randomized phase 3 clinical trial of apalutamide plus ADT in patients with castration-naÏve sensitive metastatic
prostate cancer demonstrated improved overall survival over ADT alone...
• 4th bullet modified: An open-label randomized phase 3 clinical trial of enzalutamide plus ADT in patients with castration-naÏve sensitive metastatic
prostate cancer demonstrated improved overall survival over ADT alone. In a separate double-blind randomized phase 3 clinical trial, enzalutamide
reduced the risk of metastatic progression or death compared with placebo and showed an overall survival benefit. Adverse events associated with
enzalutamide included fatigue, seizures, and hypertension.
PROS-I 4 of 5
• 3rd bullet modified: A phase 3 study of docetaxel-naÏve sensitive patients

Discussion

Updates in Version 1.2023 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2022 include:
PROS-J 1 of 3
• Heading has been removed: Non-Hormonal Systemic Therapy for Very-High-Risk Prostate Cancer
Bullet removed: Docetaxel can be added to EBRT and 2 years of ADT in patients with very-high-risk prostate cancer. In the STAMPEDE trial, the
hazard ratio for OS in 96 randomized patients with nonmetastatic disease was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.60–1.43) with the addition of docetaxel to EBRT and
ADT.
• Heading has been modified: Non-Hormonal Systemic Therapy for M1 Castration-NaÏve Sensitive Prostate Cancer
Bullet removed: Patients with high-volume, ADT-naïve, metastatic disease should be considered for ADT (See PROS-H) and docetaxel based on
the results of the ECOG 3805 (CHAARTED) trial. In this study, 790 patients were randomized to 6 cycles of docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks
with dexamethasone with ADT vs. ADT alone. In the majority subset of patients with high-volume disease, defined as 4 or more bone metastases
including one extra-axial bone lesion or visceral metastases, a 17-month improvement in overall survival was observed (HR, 0.60; P = .0006).
Improvements in PSA response, time to clinical progression, and time to recurrence were observed with use of docetaxel. Toxicities of 6 cycles of
docetaxel included fatigue, neuropathy, stomatitis, diarrhea, and neutropenia with or without fever.
• 1st bullet added: Patients with high-volume castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer who are fit for chemotherapy should be considered for ADT
plus docetaxel and either abiraterone or darolutamide based on phase 3 studies:
1st sub-bullet added: ADT plus docetaxel and abiraterone improved overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival rPFS in the openlabel PEACE-1 study. A modest increase in toxicity was seen.
2nd sub-bullet added: ADT plus docetaxel and darolutamide improved overall survival in the ARASENS trial. Adverse events were similar between
arms.
3rd sub-bullet modified: The use of myeloid growth factors should follow the NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors, based on risk of
neutropenic fever. Docetaxel should not be offered to patients with low-volume metastatic prostate cancer, since this subgroup was not shown to
have improved survival in either the ECOG study or a similar European (GETUG-AFU 15) trial.
• Non-Hormonal Systemic Therapy for M1 CRPC Chemotherapy, 3rd bullet modified: Cabazitaxel/carboplatin with concurrent prednisone steroid twice
daily
PROS-J 2 of 3
• 1st bullet modified: Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m² with concurrent steroid has been shown in a randomized phase 3 study (TROPIC) to prolong overall
survival, PFS, and PSA response, and radiologic responses when compared with mitoxantrone with and prednisone and is FDA approved in the postdocetaxel secondline setting.
• 4th bullet modified: Docetaxel retreatment can be attempted after progression on a novel hormone therapy in patients with metastatic CRPC whose
cancer has have not demonstrated definitive evidence of progression on prior docetaxel therapy in the castration-naÏve sensitive setting.
• Targeted Therapy, 1st bullet modified: Consider inclusion of olaparib in patients who have an HRR mutation and have whose cancer has progressed
on prior treatment with androgen receptor-directed therapy regardless of prior docetaxel therapy. Olaparib is a treatment option for patients with
mCRPC and a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in a homologous recombination repair gene (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1,
CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L) who have been treated previously with androgen receptordirected therapy. However, efficacy appears to be driven by the cohort of patients with at least one alteration in BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM, and in
particular, by patients with BRCA2 or BRCA1 mutations based on exploratory gene-by-gene analysis. There may be heterogeneity of response to
olaparib for non-BRCA mutations based on which gene has a the specific gene mutation.
• Immunotherapy, 3rd bullet, 1st sub-bullet modified: Pembrolizumab is recommended only as subsequent systemic therapy for patients with metastatic
CRPC who have whose cancer has progressed through prior docetaxel and/or a novel hormone therapy.

INITIAL RISK STRATIFICATION AND STAGING WORKUP FOR CLINICALLY LOCALIZED DISEASE
e Tumor-based

molecular assays and germline genetic testing are other tools that can assist with risk stratification. See Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker
Analysis (PROS-C) to determine if a patient is an appropriate candidate for germline genetic testing, and see Principles of Risk Stratification (PROS-D) to determine if
a patient is an appropriate candidate for tumor-based molecular assays. to determine if a patient is an appropriate candidate for tumor-based molecular assays.

f

For asymptomatic patients in very-low-, low-, and intermediate-risk groups with life expectancy ≤5 years, no imaging or treatment is indicated until the patient becomes
symptomatic, at which time imaging can be performed and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) should be given (See PROS-I).

g An

ultrasound- or MRI- or DRE-targeted lesion that is biopsied more than once and demonstrates cancer (regardless of percentage core involvement or number of
cores involved) can be considered as a single positive core.

h See

Principles of Imaging (PROS-E).

i Bone
j

k

imaging should be performed for any patient with symptoms consistent with bone metastases.

Bone imaging can be achieved by conventional technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan. Plain films, CT, MRI, or PET/CT or PET/MRI with F-18
sodium fluoride, C-11 choline, F-18 fluciclovine, Ga-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-11, or F-18 piflufolastat PSMA can be considered for equivocal
results on initial bone imaging. Soft tissue imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include chest CT and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI. mpMRI
is preferred over CT for pelvic staging. Alternatively, Ga-68 PSMA-11 or F-18 piflufolastat PSMA PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered for bone and soft tissue (full
body) imaging. See Principles of Imaging (PROS-E).
Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of PSMA-PET tracers for detecting micrometastatic disease compared to conventional imaging (CT, MRI) at both
initial staging and biochemical recurrence, the panel does not feel that conventional imaging is a necessary prerequisite to PSMA-PET and that PSMA-PET/CT or
PSMA-PET/MRI can serve as an equally effective, if not more effective front-line imaging tool for these patients.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

f For asymptomatic patients in very-low-, low-, and intermediate-risk groups with life

expectancy ≤5 years, no imaging or treatment is indicated until the patient becomes
symptomatic, at which time imaging can be performed and ADT should be given (See
PROS-I).

l See Principles of Life Expectancy Estimation (PROS-A).
m The panel remains concerned about the problems of overtreatment related to the

increased diagnosis of early prostate cancer from PSA testing. See NCCN Guidelines for
Prostate Cancer Early Detection. Active surveillance is recommended for this subset of
patients.

n Active surveillance involves actively monitoring the course of disease with the expectation

to intervene with potentially curative therapy if the cancer progresses. See Principles of
Active Surveillance and Observation (PROS-F).

o If higher grade and/or higher T stage is found during confirmatory testing, see PROS-2.
p See Principles of Radiation Therapy (PROS-G).
q See Principles of Surgery (PROS-H).
r Observation involves monitoring the course of disease with the expectation to deliver

palliative therapy for the development of symptoms or a change in exam or PSA that
suggests symptoms are imminent. See Principles of Active Surveillance and Observation
(PROS-F).

y PSA nadir is the lowest value reached after EBRT or brachytherapy.
z PSA persistence/recurrence after RP is defined as failure of PSA to fall to undetectable

levels (PSA persistence) or undetectable PSA after RP with a subsequent detectable
PSA that increases on 2 or more determinations (PSA recurrence) or that increases to
PSA >0.1 ng/mL.

aa RTOG-ASTRO (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group - American Society for Therapeutic

Radiology and Oncology) Phoenix Consensus: 1) PSA increase by 2 ng/mL or more
above the nadir PSA is the standard definition for PSA recurrence after EBRT with or
without HT; and 2) A recurrence evaluation should be considered when PSA has been
confirmed to be increasing after radiation even if the increase above nadir is not yet 2
ng/mL, especially in candidates for local therapy who are young and healthy. Retaining
a strict version of the ASTRO definition allows comparison with a large existing body
of literature. Rapid increase of PSA may warrant evaluation (prostate biopsy) prior to
meeting the Phoenix definition, especially in younger or healthier patients.

bb For patients with pN1 disease and PSA persistence, see PROS-10.
cc See monitoring for N1 on ADT (PROS-9).
dd Active surveillance of unfavorable intermediate and high-risk clinically localized cancers

is not recommended in patients with a life expectancy >10 years (category 1).

ee The fine-particle formulation of abiraterone can be used instead of the standard form

(category 2B; other recommended option).

s Adverse laboratory/pathologic features include: positive margin(s); seminal vesicle

ff Patients in STAMPEDE had at least two of the following: cT3–4, Grade Group 4 or 5, and

t Decipher molecular assay should be considered if not previously performed to inform

gg RP + PLND can be considered in younger, healthier patients without tumor fixation to

invasion; extracapsular extension; or detectable PSA.

adjuvant treatment if adverse features are found post-RP.

u See Principles of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (PROS-I).
v Criteria for progression are not well-defined and require physician judgment; however, a

change in risk group strongly implies disease progression. See Discussion.

w The panel recognizes that there is heterogeneity across the low-risk group, and that

some factors may be associated with an increased probability of near-term grade
reclassification, including high PSA density, a high number of positive cores (eg, ≥3),
high genomic risk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis), and/or a known BRCA2
germline mutation. In some of these cases, upfront treatment with radical prostatectomy
or prostate RT may be preferred based on shared decision-making with the patient. See
Principles of Active Surveillance and Observation (PROS-F).
x Particular consideration to active surveillance may be appropriate for those patients in
the favorable intermediate-risk group with a low percentage of Gleason pattern 4 cancer,
low tumor volume, low PSA density, and/or low genomic risk (from tissue-based molecular
tumor analysis). See Principles of Active Surveillance and Observation (PROS-F).

PSA >40 ng/mL.

the pelvic sidewall.

hh ADT or EBRT may be considered in selected patients with high- or very-high-risk

disease, where complications, such as hydronephrosis or metastasis, can be expected
within 5 years.
ii Abiraterone with ADT should be considered for a total of 2 years for those patients
with N1 disease who are treated with radiation to the prostate and pelvic nodes. (See
PROS-I).
jj There is limited evidence that RP + PLND is beneficial in the setting of node-positive
disease. Use of this approach should be limited to patients with >10-year life expectancy
and resectable disease and should be used in the context of a clinical trial or planned
multimodality approach.

PRINCIPLES OF LIFE EXPECTANCY ESTIMATION
• Life expectancy estimation is critical to informed decision-making in prostate cancer early detection and treatment.
• Estimation of life expectancy is possible for groups of patients but challenging for individuals.
• Life expectancy can be estimated using:
The Social Security Administration tables (www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4c6.html)
The WHO’s Life Tables by country (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.60000?lang=en)
The Memorial Sloan Kettering Male Life Expectancy tool https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate
• If using a life expectancy table, life expectancy should be adjusted using the clinician’s assessment of overall health as follows:
Best quartile of health - add 50%
Worst quartile of health - subtract 50%
Middle two quartiles of health - no adjustment
• Example of upper, middle, and lower quartiles of life expectancy at selected ages are included in the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult
Oncology for life expectancy estimation.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY-OF-LIFE AND SHARED DECISION-MAKING
• Treatments for patients with localized prostate cancer have risks and side effects that must be considered in the context of the risk posed
by the disease.1-4
• Baseline urinary, sexual, and bowel function are strongly associated with functional outcomes among patients undergoing treatment.1-4
• Thus, it is important to measure baseline disease specific function (urinary, sexual, and bowel function), preferably using a standardized
patient-reported outcomes instrument (eg, EPIC-265).
• Shared decision-making regarding initial management of localized prostate cancer should include an explanation of the potential benefits
and potential harms of each option. The provider should explain the likelihood of cure, recurrence, disease progression, and diseasespecific mortality with each management option, taking into account disease severity and competing risks. In addition to the primary
intended effects of treatment, the clinician should discuss the side effects of each treatment and predicted impact on quality of life,
including urinary, sexual, and bowel function. Patient preferences should be elicited and should be incorporated into the management
decision.6

PRINCIPLES OF GENETICS AND MOLECULAR/BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
GERMLINE TESTING
For details regarding the nuances of genetic counseling and testing, see Principles of Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling (EVAL-A) in
the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic.
• Pre-test Considerations
The panel recommends inquiring about family and personal history of cancer, and known germline variants at time of initial diagnosis.
Criteria for germline testing (see PROS-C, 2 of 3) should be reviewed at time of initial diagnosis and, if relevant, at recurrence.
Germline testing should be considered in appropriate individuals where it is likely to impact the prostate cancer treatment and clinical trial
options, management of risk of other cancers, and/or potential risk of cancer in family members.
• Testing
If criteria are met (see PROS-C, 2 of 3), germline multigene testing that includes at least BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, HOXB13,
MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is recommended.
Additional genes may be appropriate depending on clinical context. For example, HOXB13 is a prostate cancer risk gene that does not
have therapeutic implications in advanced disease, but testing may have utility for family counseling.
• Post-test Considerations
Post-test genetic counseling is strongly recommended if a germline mutation (pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant) is identified. Cascade
testing for relatives is critical to inform the risk for familial cancers in all relatives.
Post-test genetic counseling is recommended if positive family history but no pathogenic variant OR if only germline variants of unknown
significance (VUS) are identified. This is to ensure accurate understanding of family implications and review indications for additional
testing and/or follow-up (including clinical trials of reclassification).
Resources are available to review the available data supporting pathogenic consequences of specific variants (eg, https://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/clinvar/; https://brcaexchange.org/about/app).
Individuals should be counseled to inform providers of any updates to family cancer history.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF GENETICS AND MOLECULAR/BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
Germline testing is recommended in patients with a personal history of prostate cancer in the following scenarios:
• By prostate cancer stage or risk group (diagnosed at any age)
Metastatic, regional (node positive), very-high-risk localized, or high-risk localized prostate cancer
• By family historya and/or ancestry
≥1 first-, second-, or third-degree relative with:
◊ breast cancer at age ≤50 y
◊ colorectal or endometrial cancer at age ≤50 y
◊ male (sex assigned at birth) breast cancer at any age
◊ ovarian cancer at any age
◊ exocrine pancreatic cancer at any age
◊ metastatic, regional, very-high-risk, or high-risk prostate cancer at any age
≥1 first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with:
◊ prostate cancerb at age ≤60 y
≥2 first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with:
◊ breast cancer at any age
◊ prostate cancerb at any age
≥3 first- or second-degree relatives with:
◊ Lynch syndrome-related cancers, especially if diagnosed <50 y: colorectal, endometrial, gastric, ovarian, exocrine pancreas, upper
tract urothelial, glioblastoma, biliary tract, and small intestinal cancer
A known family history of familial cancer risk mutation (pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants), especially in: BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM,
PALB2, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM
Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry
• Personal history of breast cancer
Germline testing may be considered in patients with a personal history of prostate cancer in the following scenarios:
• By prostate cancer tumor characteristics (diagnosed at any age)
◊ intermediate-risk prostate cancer with intraductal/cribriform histologyc
• By prostate cancerb AND a prior personal history of any of the following cancers:
◊ exocrine pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, melanoma, upper tract urothelial, glioblastoma, biliary tract, and small intestinal

blood relatives include first-, second-, and third-degree relatives on the same side of the family. See Pedigree: First-, Second-, and Third-Degree Relatives of
Proband (EVAL-B) in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic.
b Family history of prostate cancer should not include relatives with clinically localized Grade Group 1 disease.
c Acinar prostate adenocarcinoma with invasive cribriform pattern, intraductal carcinoma of prostate, or ductal adenocarcinoma component have increased genomic
instability, and germline testing may be considered.
Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

PRINCIPLES OF GENETICS AND MOLECULAR/BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
SOMATIC TUMOR TESTING
• Pre-test Considerations
At present, tumor molecular and biomarker analysis may be used for treatment decision-making, including understanding eligibility for
biomarker-directed treatments, genetic counseling, early use of platinum chemotherapy, and eligibility for clinical trials. Clinical trials may
include established and/or candidate molecular biomarkers for eligibility.
Tumor molecular profiles may change with subsequent treatments and re-evaluation may be considered at time of cancer progression for
treatment decision-making.
Patients should be informed that tumor molecular analysis by DNA sequencing has the potential to uncover germline findings.
Confirmatory germline testing may be recommended [see Post-test Considerations, below, and see Tumor Testing: Potential Implications
for Germline Testing in the Principles of Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling (EVAL-A) in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial
High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic]
• Testing
Tumor testing for alterations in homologous recombination DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D,
CHEK2, and CDK12, is recommended in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. This testing can be considered in patients with regional
prostate cancer.
Tumor testing for MSI-H or dMMR is recommended in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and may be considered
in patients with regional or castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer.
TMB testing may be considered in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
• Tumor Specimen and Assay Considerations
The panel strongly recommends a metastatic biopsy for histologic and molecular evaluation. When unsafe or unfeasible, plasma
ciculating tumor (ctDNA) assay is an option, preferably collected during biochemical (PSA) and/or radiographic progression in order to
maximize diagnostic yield.
Caution is needed when interpreting ctDNA-only evaluation due to potential interference from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate
potential (CHIP), which can result in a false-positive biomarker signal.
DNA analysis for MSI and immunohistochemistry for MMR are different assays measuring different biological effects caused by dMMR
function. If MSI is used, testing using an a next-generation sequencing assay validated for prostate cancer is preferred.
• Post-test Considerations
Post-test genetic counseling is recommended if pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant (mutation) identified in any gene that has clinical
implications if also identified in germline (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, HOXB13, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2).
Post-test genetic counseling to assess for the possibility of Lynch syndrome is recommended if MSI-H or dMMR is found.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF RISK STRATIFICATION
• The purpose of NCCN risk groups is to provide a method for risk stratification to allow standardized treatment recommendations to be
provided.
It is acknowledged that there are methods of risk stratification that have been designed with superior performance, but have not been
routinely reported in clinical trials. This limits the ability to provide evidence-based guideline treatment recommendations using these
methods.
Thus, the NCCN Guidelines continue to use NCCN risk groups as a framework. However, the panel acknowledges the ability to personalize
treatment decisions through improved tools for risk stratification and have created this section to assist.
• Current treatment recommendations for localized through recurrent prostate cancer are based on prognosis, rather than use of predictive
biomarkers. Prognosis is estimated through risk stratification.
The only identified exception to this, from a routine clinical or pathologic variable with randomized clinical trial validation, is pre-salvage
radiotherapy PSA level, which has been shown to be both prognostic and predictive of benefit from hormone therapy with salvage
radiotherapy in a phase III randomized trial.1,2
• Clinical trials that have established the benefit of various treatments in localized and recurrent prostate cancer often enroll patients
across a spectrum of risk. Subgroup analyses, absolute benefit estimates, and expert opinion are used to provide simplified treatment
recommendations for each NCCN risk group.
Given the moderate performance of NCCN risk groups to risk stratify localized prostate cancer, there is intrinsic heterogeneity in prognosis
within a given NCCN risk group. Thus, treatment recommendations for adjacent risk groups may be appropriate when using more accurate
risk stratification methods.
• Multivariable models should be used for risk stratification.
Multivariable risk stratification models, such as NCCN and STAR-CAP,3 incorporate routine clinical (ie, PSA, T stage) and pathologic
variables (ie, Grade Group, percent positive cores), and outperform a single clinical or pathologic feature for risk stratification.
Multivariable models, such as gene expression classifiers or artificial intelligence (AI)-derived digital histopathology biomarkers, can
combine clinical, pathologic, and other biomarkers to further improve risk stratification.
• There are newer risk classification models that have been shown to outperform NCCN risk groups.3,4 There are also common histopathology
variables that are prognostic (ie, cribriform, intraductal carcinoma, percent Gleason pattern 4); however, they have been rarely reported in
the context of clinical trials.
• Imaging (ie, MRI and PET/CT) can also aid in risk stratification. See Principles of Imaging (PROS-E).

PRINCIPLES OF RISK STRATIFICATION
• There are advanced risk stratification tools (ie, gene expression biomarkers, AI digital pathology5) that independently improve risk
stratification. See Table 1: Initial Risk Stratification for Clinically Localized Disease.
These tools are recommended to be used when they will have the potential ability to change management. These tools should not be
ordered reflexively.
There are an extensive number of these tools created with substantial variability in quality of reporting and model design, endpoint
selection, and quality and caliber of validation. It is recommended to use models that have high-quality and robust validation, ideally with
randomized clinical trial data across multiple clinical trials.
These tools are not recommended for patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer.
Patients with NCCN low, favorable intermediate, unfavorable intermediate, or high-risk disease and life expectancy ≥10 y may consider the
use of the following tumor-based molecular assays: Decipher, Oncotype DX Prostate, and Prolaris.
AI digital pathology can be used for patients with localized prostate cancer with life expectancy ≥10 years if the results will impact
management (category 2B).5
The data are limited and inconsistent regarding the prognostic impact of germline testing results for localized prostate cancer, and thus
there is poor quality evidence to use this information to change treatment recommendations. The current evidence in localized prostate
cancer is limited to small retrospective series with inconsistent results, and none has assessed the independent prognostic effect of
germline mutation in complete multivariable clinical and pathologic models.6-9 The prognostic impact of germline testing results should be
viewed as distinct from the purposes for cascade testing, see PROS-C.

a "Endpoint trained for" specifically relates to what the biomarker or model was designed and optimized to predict. This is distinct from endpoints for which the biomarker has been shown

to be prognostic in validation.

b Levels of evidence for biomarkers in this section are based on modified Simon et al criteria:10

1: Validation in the context of multiple clinical trials with consistent results. Randomized trials are necessary for predictive biomarkers for validation.
2: Validation in multiple independent prospective registry/observational cohorts with consistent results.
3: Validation in multiple independent retrospective studies with consistent results.
4: Validation in a single retrospective study, or multiple independent retrospective studies with inconsistent results.
c NCCN risk groups were not trained for a specific endpoint. They were a modification of the original D’Amico risk groups trained for BCR. Subsequently, NCCN risk groups were
subdivided into seven risk groups (very low, low, favorable intermediate, unfavorable intermediate, high, very high, and regional disease).
d CAPRA does not include cT3b–T4 or cN+ patients.
e ArteraAI Prostate, also known as a multi-modal AI biomarker, has trained and validated multiple AI-derived digital histopathology-based biomarkers from five phase III randomized
radiation-based trials.5
f These are two separate models developed and trained for different endpoints.
g ArteraAI Prostate trained three distinct prognostic models, one for each endpoint (BCR, DM, and PCSM).
h Prolaris is a composite of CAPRA and cell cycle progression (CCP) score. The derivation of CCP was based on genes involved in the cell cycle that were highly correlated and provided
highly reproducible measurements of cell proliferation. Like other biomarkers it has been validated for multiple endpoints, but the test was not specifically trained for an endpoint a
priori.16
i Studies have inconsistent results in the setting of small biomarker-positive sample sizes. In addition, studies commonly do not adjust for standard clinical and pathologic factors and have
variable follow-up and heterogeneous reporting quality.

Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF IMAGING
Goals of Imaging
• Imaging is performed for the detection and characterization of disease
to select treatment or guide change in management.
• Imaging techniques can evaluate anatomic or functional parameters.
Anatomic imaging techniques include plain film radiographs,
ultrasound, CT, and MRI.
Functional imaging techniques include radionuclide bone scan,
PET/CT, and advanced MRI techniques, such as spectroscopy and
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).
Efficacy of Imaging
• The utility of imaging for patients with early PSA persistence/
recurrence after RP depends on risk group prior to operation,
pathologic Gleason grade and stage, PSA, and PSADT after
recurrence. Low- and intermediate-risk groups with low serum PSAs
postoperatively have a very low risk of positive bone scans or CT
scans.
• Frequency of imaging should be based on individual risk, age, PSADT,
Gleason score, and overall health.
• Conventional bone scans are rarely positive in asymptomatic patients
with PSA <10 ng/mL. The relative risk for bone metastasis or death
increases as PSADT shortens. Bone imaging should be performed
more frequently when PSADT ≤8 months, where there appears to be an
inflection point.
Plain Radiography
• Plain radiography can be used to evaluate symptomatic regions in the
skeleton. However, conventional plain x-rays will not detect a bone
lesion until nearly 50% of the mineral content of the bone is lost or
gained.
• CT or MRI may be more useful to assess fracture risk as these
modalities permit more accurate assessment of cortical involvement
than plain films where osteoblastic lesions may obscure cortical
involvement.

Ultrasound
• Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to image small
regions of the body.
Standard ultrasound imaging provides anatomic information.
Vascular flow can be assessed using Doppler ultrasound
techniques.
• Endorectal ultrasound is used to guide transrectal biopsies of the
prostate. Endorectal ultrasound can be considered for patients
with suspected recurrence after RP to guide prostate bed biopsy.
• Advanced ultrasound techniques for imaging of the prostate and
for differentiation between prostate cancer and prostatitis are
under evaluation.
Bone Imaging
• The use of the term “bone scan” refers to the conventional
technetium-99m-MDP bone scan in which technetium is taken up
by bone that is turning over and imaged with a gamma camera
using planar imaging or 3-D imaging with single-photon emission
CT (SPECT).
Sites of increased uptake imply accelerated bone turnover and
may indicate metastatic disease.
Osseous metastatic disease may be diagnosed based on the
overall pattern of activity, or in conjunction with anatomic
imaging.
• Bone imaging is indicated in the initial evaluation of patients at
high risk for skeletal metastases.
• Bone imaging can be considered for the evaluation of the
patient post-prostatectomy when there is failure of PSA to fall to
undetectable levels, or when there is undetectable PSA after RP
with a subsequent detectable PSA that increases on 2 or more
subsequent determinations.
• Bone imaging can be considered for the evaluation of patients
with an increasing PSA or positive DRE after RT if the patient is a
candidate for additional local therapy or systemic therapy.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF IMAGING
• Bone scans are helpful to monitor metastatic prostate cancer to
determine the clinical benefit of systemic therapy. However, new
lesions seen on an initial post-treatment bone scan, compared to the
pre-treatment baseline scan, may not indicate disease progression.
• New lesions in the setting of a falling PSA or soft tissue response
and in the absence of pain progression at that site may indicate
bone scan flare or an osteoblastic healing reaction. For this
reason, a confirmatory bone scan 8–12 weeks later is warranted
to determine true progression from flare reaction. Additional new
lesions favor progression. Stable scans make continuation of
treatment reasonable. Bone scan flare is common, particularly on
initiation of new hormonal therapy, and may be observed in nearly
half of patients treated with the newer agents, enzalutamide and
abiraterone. Similar flare phenomena may exist with other imaging
modalities, such as CT or PET/CT imaging.
• Bone scans and soft tissue imaging (CT or MRI) in patients with
metastatic or non-metastatic prostate cancer may be obtained
regularly during systemic therapy to assess clinical benefit.
• Bone scans should be performed for symptoms and as often as
every 6–12 mo to monitor ADT. The need for soft tissue images
remains unclear. In CRPC, 8- to 12-week imaging intervals appear
reasonable.
• PET imaging for detection of bone metastatic disease
Plain films, CT, MRI, PET/CT, or PET/MRI with F-18 piflufolastat
PSMA, Ga-68 PSMA-11, F-18 sodium fluoride, C-11 choline, or F-18
fluciclovine can be considered for equivocal results on initial bone
scan.
Ga-68 PSMA-11 or F-18 piflufolastat PSMA PET/CT or PET/MRI (full
body imaging) can be considered as an alternative to bone scan.
Computed Tomography
• CT provides a high level of anatomic detail, and may detect gross
extracapsular disease, nodal metastatic disease, and/or visceral
metastatic disease.
• CT is generally not sufficient to evaluate the prostate gland.

• CT may be performed with IV contrast, and CT technique should be
optimized to maximize diagnostic utility while minimizing radiation
dose.
• CT can be used for examination of the pelvis and/or abdomen for
initial evaluation (see PROS-2) and as part of workup for recurrence
or progression (see PROS-11 through PROS-15).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
• The strengths of MRI include high soft tissue contrast and
characterization, multiparametric image acquisition, multiplanar
imaging capability, and advanced computational methods to assess
function.
MRI can be performed with and without the administration of IV
contrast material.
Resolution of MRI images in the pelvis can be augmented using an
endorectal coil.
• Standard MRI techniques can be used for examination of the pelvis
and/or abdomen for initial evaluation (see PROS-2) and as part of
workup for recurrence or progression (see PROS-11 through PROS15).
• MRI may be considered in patients after RP when PSA fails to fall
to undetectable levels or when an undetectable PSA becomes
detectable and increases on 2 or more subsequent determinations,
or after RT for increasing PSA or positive DRE if the patient is
a candidate for additional local therapy. MRI-ultrasound fusion
biopsy may improve the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥2)
cancers.
• mpMRI can be used in the staging and characterization of prostate
cancer. mpMRI images are defined as images acquired with at
least one more sequence in addition to the anatomical T2-weighted
images, such as DWI or dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images.
mpMRI may be used to better risk stratify patients who are
considering active surveillance. Additionally, mpMRI may detect
large and poorly differentiated prostate cancer (Grade Group ≥2)
and detect extracapsular extension (T staging) and is preferred
over CT for abdominal/pelvic staging. mpMRI has been shown to be
equivalent to CT scan for pelvic lymph node evaluation.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE AND OBSERVATION
• The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel and the NCCN Prostate Cancer Early Detection Panel (See NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer
Early Detection) remain concerned about overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Panel recommends that
patients and their physicians carefully consider active surveillance based on the patient’s prostate cancer risk profile and estimated life
expectancy. In settings where the patient’s age and comorbidities suggest a shorter life expectancy, observation may be more appropriate.
Shared decision-making, after appropriate counseling on the risks and benefits of the various options, is critical.
ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE1
• Active surveillance involves actively monitoring the course of disease with the expectation to intervene with curative intent if the cancer
progresses.
• Life Expectancy:
Life expectancy is a key determinant for the choice between observation, active surveillance, and definitive treatment.
Consider incorporating a validated metric of comorbidity such as the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 Index (ACE-27)2 to differentiate
between recommendations for observation versus active surveillance. Prior studies did not incorporate a validated metric of comorbidity
to estimate life expectancy (See Table 1 on PROS-F 4 of 5), which is a potential limitation when interpreting the data for a patient who is in
excellent health.
Life expectancy can be challenging to estimate for individual patients (see Principles of Life Expectancy Estimation, PROS-A).
• Candidacy for Active Surveillance:
Active surveillance is preferred for patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer (See Risk Group Criteria [PROS-2]) and a life expectancy ≥10
years. (Observation is preferred for patients with a life expectancy <10 years and very-low-risk disease.)
Active surveillance is preferred for most patients with low-risk prostate cancer (See Risk Group Criteria [PROS-2]) and a life expectancy ≥10
years. The panel recognizes that there is heterogeneity across this risk group, and that some factors may be associated with an increased
probability of near-term grade reclassification including high PSA density, a high number of positive cores (eg, ≥3), and high genomic risk
(from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis).3 In some of these cases, upfront treatment with RP or prostate RT may be preferred based
on shared decision-making with the patient.
Patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (See Risk Group Criteria [PROS-2]) and a life expectancy >10 years may also
consider active surveillance. Particular consideration for active surveillance may be appropriate for those patients with a low percentage
of Gleason pattern 4 cancer, low tumor volume, low PSA density, and/or low genomic risk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis).
See Discussion.
Please see Table 1 (PROS-F 4 of 5) below for a summary of major active surveillance cohorts, including their inclusion criteria.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

Goals of confirmatory testing are to help facilitate early identification of those patients who may be at a higher risk of future grade
reclassification or cancer progression.
Since an initial prostate biopsy may underestimate tumor grade or volume, confirmatory testing is strongly recommended within the first 6
to 12 months of diagnosis for patients who are considering active surveillance.
Options for confirmatory testing include prostate biopsy, mpMRI with calculation of PSA density (and repeat biopsy as indicated), and/or
molecular tumor analysis, see Principles of Risk Stratification (PROS-D).
Early confirmatory testing may not be necessary in patients who have had an mpMRI prior to diagnostic biopsy.
All patients should undergo a confirmatory prostate biopsy within 1–2 years of their diagnostic biopsy.
• Active Surveillance Program:
Patients who choose active surveillance should have regular follow-up, and key principles include:
◊ PSA no more often than every 6 months unless clinically indicated.
◊ DRE no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated.
◊ Repeat prostate biopsy no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated. While the intensity of surveillance may be
tailored on an individual basis, most patients should have prostate biopsies incorporated as part of their monitoring.
◊ Consider repeat mpMRI no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated.
◊ In patients with a suspicious lesion on mpMRI, MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy improves the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥2)
cancers.
◊ Patients should be transitioned to observation when life expectancy is <10 years.
◊ Repeat molecular tumor analysis is discouraged.
◊ The intensity of surveillance may be tailored based on patient life expectancy and risk of reclassification.
• Considerations for Treatment of Patients on Active Surveillance:
Grade reclassification on repeat biopsy is the most common factor influencing a change in management from active surveillance to
treatment.
Other factors affecting decisions to actively treat include: increase in tumor volume, a rise in PSA density, and patient anxiety.
Considerations for a change in management strategy should be made in the context of the patient’s life expectancy.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE AND OBSERVATION
• Advantages of active surveillance:
Between 50% and 68% of those eligible for active surveillance may safely avoid treatment for at least 10 years.4-6
Patients will avoid possible side effects of definitive therapy that may be unnecessary while on active surveillance.
Quality of life/normal activities will be less affected while on active surveillance.
Risk of unnecessary treatment of small, indolent cancers will be reduced.
• Limitations of active surveillance:
Between 32% and 50% of patients will undergo treatment by 10 years,4-6 although treatment delays do not seem to impact cure rate.
Although the risk is very low (<0.5% in most series), it is possible for a cancer to progress to a regional or metastatic stage.4-6
OBSERVATION
• Observation involves monitoring with a history and physical exam no more often than every 12 months (without surveillance biopsies) until
symptoms develop or are thought to be imminent.
• Observation is recommended for:
Asymptomatic patients in very-low-, low-, and intermediate-risk groups with life a expectancy ≤5 years.
Asymptomatic patients with very-low- and low-risk prostate cancer with a life expectancy 5–10 years.
• Observation is preferred for:
Asymptomatic patients with favorable and unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy between 5–10 years.
• Observation may be considered for:
Asymptomatic patients with high-risk, very-high-risk, regional, and metastatic prostate cancer and life expectancy ≤5 years.
• Life expectancy can be challenging to estimate for individual patients (see Principles of Life Expectancy Estimation, PROS-A). Consider
incorporating a validated metric of comorbidity (see Life Expectancy, above).
• If patients under observation become symptomatic, an assessment of disease burden can be performed, and treatment or palliation can be
considered (see PROS-12).
• Advantages of observation:
Patients will avoid possible side effects of unnecessary confirmatory testing and definitive therapy.
• Limitation of observation:
There may be a risk of local or systemic symptoms (eg, urinary retention, pathologic fracture), without prior symptoms or concerning PSA
levels.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
Definitive Radiation Therapy General Principles
• Highly conformal RT techniques should be used to treat localized
prostate cancer.
• Photon or proton EBRT are both effective at achieving highly
conformal radiotherapy with acceptable and similar biochemical
control and long-term side effect profiles (See Discussion).
• Ideally, the accuracy of treatment should be verified by daily
prostate localization, with any of the following: techniques of
image-guided RT (IGRT) using CT, ultrasound, implanted fiducials,
or electromagnetic targeting/tracking. Endorectal balloons may
be used to improve prostate immobilization. Biocompatible and
biodegradable perirectal spacer materials may be implanted
between the prostate and rectum in patients undergoing external
radiotherapy with organ-confined prostate cancer in order to
displace the rectum from high radiation dose regions. A randomized
phase III trial demonstrated reduced rectal bleeding in patients
undergoing the procedure compared to controls. Retrospective data
also support its use in similar patients undergoing brachytherapy.
Patients with obvious rectal invasion or visible T3 and posterior
extension should not undergo perirectal spacer implantation.
• Various fractionation and dose regimens can be considered
depending on the clinical scenario (See Table 1 on PROS-G 4 of 7).
Dose escalation has been proven to achieve the best biochemical
control in patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease.
• Stereotactic body RT (SBRT) is acceptable in practices with
appropriate technology, physics, and clinical expertise. SBRT for
metastases can be considered in the following circumstances:
In a patient with limited metastatic disease to the vertebra or
paravertebral region when ablation is the goal (eg, concern for
impending fracture or tumor encroachment on spinal nerves or
vertebra)
In a patient with oligometastatic progression where progressionfree survival is the goal
In a symptomatic patient where the lesion occurs in or immediately
adjacent to a previously irradiated treatment field.

• Biologically effective dose (BED) modeling with the linear-quadratic
equation may not be accurate for extremely hypofractionated
(SBRT/stereotactic ablative radiotherapy [SABR]) radiation.
• Brachytherapy:
Interstitial implantation of prostate +/- proximal seminal vesicles
with temporary (high dose-rate, HDR) or permanent (low dose-rate,
LDR) radioactive sources for monotherapy or as "boost" when
added to EBRT should be performed in practices with adequate
training, experience, and quality assurance measures.
Patient selection should consider aspects of gland size, baseline
urinary symptoms, and prior procedures (ie, transurethral
resection of prostate) that may increase risk of adverse effects.
Neoadjuvant ADT to shrink a gland to allow treatment should
balance its additional toxicity with this benefit.
Post-implant dosimetry must be performed for LDR implants to
verify dosimetry.
Brachytherapy boost, when added to EBRT and ADT, improves
biochemical control. To address historical trial data concerns
for increased toxicity incidence, careful patient selection and
contemporary planning associated with lesser toxicity, such as
use of recognized organ at risk (OAR) dose constraints, use of
high-quality ultrasound and other imaging, and prescription of
dose as close as possible to the target without excessive margins
should be implemented.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
Definitive Radiation Therapy by Risk Group
• Very low risk
Patients with NCCN very-low-risk prostate cancer are encouraged
to pursue active surveillance.
• Low risk
Patients with NCCN low-risk prostate cancer are encouraged to
pursue active surveillance.
Prophylactic lymph node radiation should NOT be performed
routinely. ADT or antiandrogen therapy should NOT be used
routinely.
• Favorable intermediate riska
Prophylactic lymph node radiation is not performed routinely, and
ADT or antiandrogen therapy is not used routinely. Prophylactic
lymph node radiation and/or ADT use is reasonable if additional
risk assessments suggest aggressive tumor behavior.
• Unfavorable intermediate riska
Prophylactic nodal radiation can be considered if additional risk
assessments suggest aggressive tumor behavior. ADT should
be used unless additional risk assessments suggest lessaggressive tumor behavior or if medically contraindicated. The
duration of ADT can be reduced when combined with EBRT and
brachytherapy. Brachytherapy combined with ADT (without EBRT),
or SBRT combined with ADT can be considered if delivering
longer courses of EBRT would present medical or social hardship.
• High and very high riska
Prophylactic nodal radiation should be considered. ADT is
required unless medically contraindicated. Brachytherapy
combined with ADT (without EBRT), or SBRT combined with ADT,
can be considered if delivering longer courses of EBRT would
present a medical or social hardship.

• Regional disease
Nodal radiation should be performed. Clinically positive nodes
should be dose-escalated as dose-volume histogram parameters
allow. ADT is required unless medically contraindicated, and the
addition of abiraterone or fine-particle abiraterone (category 2B) to
ADT is preferred.
• Low metastatic burden, castration-sensitive disease
RT to the prostate is an option in patients with low metastatic
burden castration-sensitive metastatic disease, without
contraindications to radiotherapy. ADT is required unless
medically contraindicated.
• Low metastatic burden is defined as either non-regional, lymphnode-only disease OR <4 bone metastases and without visceral/
other metastasis.
◊ Number and location of lesions is defined by conventional
imaging.
◊ At this time, metastases defined only by PET imaging should
not be used to exclude a patient from treatment of the primary
tumor.
• This recommendation is based on the STAMPEDE phase 3
randomized trial, which randomized 2061 patients to standard
systemic therapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary. The
overall cohort had a significant improvement from the addition of
radiotherapy to the primary in failure-free survival, but not overall
survival. The prespecified low-volume subset had a significant
improvement in both failure-free survival and overall survival.1
A meta-analysis with two other studies confirmed this benefit for
primary RT to the primary tumor in lower volume disease.2

the setting of conventionally fractionated EBRT. If using micro-boost, it is critical to restrict dose to OARs to meet constraints that would normally have been achieved
without such boost, sacrificing dose coverage of the boost as needed. Further, careful IGRT and delivery procedures should be developed in line with the technical
demands of this approach.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
Salvage Brachytherapy
• Permanent LDR or temporary HDR brachytherapy is a treatment
option for pathologically confirmed local recurrence after EBRT or
brachytherapy. Subjects should have restaging imaging according
to the NCCN high-risk stratification group to rule out regional nodal
or metastatic disease. Patients should be counseled that salvage
brachytherapy significantly increases the probability of urologic,
sexual, and bowel toxicity compared to primary brachytherapy.
Post-Prostatectomy Radiation Therapy
• The panel recommends use of nomograms and consideration of age
and comorbidities, clinical and pathologic information, PSA levels,
PSADT, and Decipher molecular assay to individualize treatment
discussion. Patients with high Decipher genomic classifier scores
(GC >0.6) should be strongly considered for EBRT and addition of
ADT when the opportunity for early EBRT has been missed.
EBRT with 2 years of 150 mg/day of bicalutamide demonstrated
improved overall and metastasis-free survival on a prospective
randomized trial (RTOG 9601) versus radiation alone in the salvage
setting. A secondary analysis of RTOG 9601 found that patients
with PSA ≤0.6 ng/mL had no overall survival improvement with
the addition of the antiandrogen to EBRT. In addition, results of
a retrospective analysis of RP specimens from patients in RTOG
9601 suggest that those with low PSA and a low Decipher score
derived less benefit (development of distant metastases, overall
survival) from bicalutamide than those with a high Decipher score.
EBRT with 6 months of ADT (luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone [LHRH] agonist) improved biochemical or clinical
progression at 5 years on a prospective randomized trial
(GETUG-16) versus radiation alone in patients with rising PSA
levels between 0.2 and 2.0 ng/mL after RP.

• The panel recommends consultation with the American Society
for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)/American Urological Association
(AUA) Guidelines. Evidence supports offering adjuvant/salvage RT
in most patients with adverse pathologic features or detectable PSA
and no evidence of disseminated disease.
• Indications for adjuvant RT include pT3a disease, positive margin(s),
or seminal vesicle involvement. Adjuvant RT is usually given within
1 year after RP and after operative side effects have improved/
stabilized. Patients with positive surgical margins may benefit the
most.
• Indications for salvage RT include an undetectable PSA
that becomes subsequently detectable and increases on 2
measurements or a PSA that remains persistently detectable after
RP. Treatment is more effective when pre-treatment PSA is low and
PSADT is long.
• The recommended prescribed doses for adjuvant/salvage postprostatectomy RT are 64–72 Gy in standard fractionation. Biopsyproven gross recurrence may require higher doses.
• Nuclear medicine advanced imaging techniques can be useful
for localizing disease with PSA levels as low as 0.5 ng/mL (see
Discussion).
• Nomograms, and tumor-based molecular assays, can be used
to prognosticate risk of metastasis and prostate cancer-specific
mortality in patients with adverse risk features after RP.
• Target volumes include the prostate bed and may include the whole
pelvis according to physician discretion.

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY
Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection
• Extended PLND provides more complete staging and may cure
some patients with microscopic metastases; therefore, an extended
PLND is preferred when PLND is performed.
• An extended PLND includes removal of all node-bearing tissue
from an area bound by the external iliac vein anteriorly, the pelvic
sidewall laterally, the bladder wall medially, the floor of the pelvis
posteriorly, Cooper's ligament distally, and the internal iliac artery
proximally.
• While PLND at the time of RP has not been shown to improve
oncologic outcomes, it can provide staging and prognostic
information.1
• A PLND can be excluded in patients with low predicated probability
of nodal metastases by nomograms, although some patients
with lymph node metastases will be missed. There is no single
evidence-based threshold for performing PLND. Based on the risk of
complications with PLND and extra time to perform the procedure,
the published thresholds range from 2% to 7%.2-5
• A patient who is above the threshold for performing a PLND, but
has a negative PSMA PET scan should still undergo PLND. In
two studies, the sensitivity of PSMA PET for pelvic lymph node
involvement among patients undergoing RP and PLND was low
(about 40%), and the negative predictive value was about 81%.6,7
Thus, basing the decision to perform PLND on a negative PSMA PET
scan could result in missing 19% of patients with positive lymph
nodes.
• PLND can be performed using an open, laparoscopic, or robotic
technique.

Radical Prostatectomy
• RP is an appropriate therapy for any patient with clinically localized
prostate cancer that can be completely excised surgically, who has
a life expectancy of ≥10 years, and who has no serious comorbid
conditions that would contraindicate an elective operation.
• High-volume surgeons in high-volume centers generally provide
better outcomes.
• Blood loss can be substantial with RP, but can be reduced by using
laparoscopic or robotic assistance or by careful control of the
dorsal vein complex and periprostatic vessels when performed as
open surgery.
• Urinary incontinence can be reduced by preservation of urethral
length beyond the apex of the prostate and avoiding damage to
the distal sphincter mechanism. Bladder neck preservation may
decrease the risk of incontinence. Anastomotic strictures increase
the risk of long-term incontinence.
• Recovery of erectile function is directly related to age at RP,
preoperative erectile function, and the degree of preservation of the
cavernous nerves. Replacement of resected nerves with nerve grafts
has not been shown to be beneficial. Early restoration of erections
may improve late recovery.
Salvage Radical Prostatectomy
• Salvage RP is an option for highly selected patients with local
recurrence after EBRT, brachytherapy, or cryotherapy in the
absence of metastases, but the morbidity (ie, incontinence, loss of
erection, anastomotic stricture) is high and the operation should be
performed by surgeons who are experienced with salvage RP.

PRINCIPLES OF ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY

ADT for Clinically Localized (N0,M0) Disease
• Neoadjuvant ADT for RP is strongly discouraged outside of a clinical trial.
• ADT should not be used as monotherapy in clinically localized prostate
cancer unless there is a contraindication to definitive local therapy such
as life expectancy ≤5 years and comorbidities. Under those circumstances,
ADT may be used [see ADT for Patients on Observation Who Require
Treatment and Those with Life Expectancy ≤5 Years (PROS-I, 4 of 5)].
• Giving ADT before, during, and/or after radiation (neoadjuvant, concurrent,
and/or adjuvant ADT) prolongs survival in selected radiation-managed
patients. Options are:
LHRH agonist alone
◊ Goserelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin
LHRH agonist (as above) plus first-generation antiandrogen
◊ Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide
LHRH antagonist
◊ Degarelix or relugolix
LHRH agonist or degarelix with abiraterone (very high risk only)
• Studies of short-term (4–6 mo) and long-term (2–3 y) neoadjuvant,
concurrent, and/or adjuvant ADT all have used combined androgen
blockade. Whether the addition of an antiandrogen is necessary requires
further study.
• The largest randomized trial to date using the antiandrogen bicalutamide
alone at high dose (150 mg) showed a delay in recurrence of disease but
no improvement in survival; however, longer follow-up is needed.
• Abiraterone can be added to EBRT and 2 years of ADT in patients with
very-high-risk prostate cancer. In the STAMPEDE trial, the hazard ratios
for overall survival with the addition of abiraterone to EBRT and ADT in
patients with node-negative disease was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.49–0.96).
Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid:
◊ Prednisone 5 mg PO once daily for the standard formulation
◊ Methylprednisolone 4 mg PO twice daily for the fine-particle
formulation (category 2B).

ADT for Regional (N1,M0) Disease
• Patients with N1,M0 prostate cancer and a life expectancy >5 years can be
treated with:
EBRT and neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant ADT as for patients
with N0,M0 disease (see above) without abiraterone
EBRT and neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant LHRH agonist or
degarelix with abiraterone
ADT alone or with abiraterone (see below)
• Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid:
Prednisone 5 mg PO once daily for the standard formulation
Methylprednisolone 4 mg PO twice daily for the fine-particle formulation
(category 2B)
Abiraterone with ADT should be considered for a total of 2 years for those
patients with N1 disease who are treated with radiation to the prostate
and pelvic nodes.
• Options for ADT are:
Orchiectomy
LHRH agonist alone
◊ Goserelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin
LHRH agonist (as above) plus first-generation antiandrogen
◊ Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide
LHRH antagonist
◊ Degarelix or relugolix
Orchiectomy plus abiraterone
LHRH agonist (as above) plus abiraterone
Degarelix plus abiraterone
Patients with regional disease and life expectancy <5 years who chose
ADT can receive LHRH agonist, LHRH antagonist, or orchiectomy.
ADT for pN1 Disease
• In one randomized trial, immediate and continuous use of ADT in patients
with positive nodes following RP resulted in significantly improved overall
survival compared to patients who received delayed ADT. Therefore,
such patients should be considered for immediate LHRH agonist, LHRH
antagonist, or orchiectomy. EBRT may be added (category 2B), in which
case the ADT options are as for neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant
ADT for clinically localized disease (see above). Many of the side effects of
continuous ADT are cumulative over time on ADT.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY

ADT for M0 PSA Persistence/Recurrence After RP or EBRT (ADT for M0
Castration-Sensitive Disease)
• The timing of ADT for patients whose only evidence of cancer after
definitive treatment is an increasing PSA is influenced by PSA velocity,
patient anxiety, the short- and long-term side effects of ADT, and the
underlying comorbidities of the patient.
• Most patients will have a good 15-year prognosis, but their prognosis is
best approximated by the absolute level of PSA, the rate of change in the
PSA level (PSADT), and the initial stage, grade, and PSA level at the time of
definitive therapy.
• Earlier ADT may be better than delayed ADT, although the definitions of
early and late (what level of PSA) are controversial. Since the benefit of
early ADT is not clear, treatment should be individualized until definitive
studies are done. Patients with a shorter PSADT (or a rapid PSA velocity)
and an otherwise long life expectancy should be encouraged to consider
ADT earlier.
• Some patients are candidates for salvage therapy after PSA persistence/
recurrence. See PROS-10 and PROS-11.
• Patients with prolonged PSADTs (>12 months) and who are older are
candidates for observation.
• Patients who choose ADT should consider intermittent ADT. A phase 3 trial
that compared intermittent to continuous ADT showed that intermittent
ADT was not inferior to continuous ADT with respect to survival, and
quality of life was better for the intermittent ADT arm. The 7% increase in
prostate cancer deaths in the intermittent ADT arm was balanced by more
non-prostate cancer deaths in the continuous ADT arm. An unplanned
subset analysis showed that patients with Grade Group 4 or 5 prostate
cancer in the continuous arm had a median overall survival that was 14
months longer (8 years) than those in the intermittent arm (6.8 years).
• ADT options are:
M0 RP PSA persistence/recurrence:
◊ EBRT +/- neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant ADT [See ADT for
Clinically Localized (N0,M0) Disease]
◊ EBRT + LHRH agonist or degarelix with abiraterone (studies positive
for pelvic recurrence only)
M0 RT recurrence, biopsy negative or M0 PSA recurrence after
progression on salvage EBRT:
◊ Orchiectomy

◊ LHRH agonist alone
– Goserelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin
◊ LHRH agonist (as above) plus first-generation antiandrogen
– Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide
◊ LHRH antagonist
– Degarelix or relugolix
Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid [see ADT for
Regional (N1,M0) Disease].

ADT for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Disease
• ADT with treatment intensification is preferred for most patients with
metastatic prostate cancer. ADT alone is appropriate for some patients.
• Treatment options for patients with M1 castration-sensitive disease are:
ADT alone (orchiectomy, LHRH agonist, LHRH agonist plus firstgeneration antiandrogen, or LHRH antagonist)
◊ LHRH agonists: Goserelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin
◊ First-generation antiandrogens: Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide
◊ A first-generation antiandrogen must be given with LHRH agonist
for ≥7 days to prevent testosterone flare if metastases are present in
weight-bearing bone
Orchiectomy plus abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide
Orchiectomy plus docetaxel and abiraterone or darolutamide
LHRH agonist (as above) plus abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide
LHRH agonist (as above) plus docetaxel and abiraterone or darolutamide
Degarelix plus abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide
Degarelix plus docetaxel and abiraterone or darolutamide
• Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid [see ADT for Regional
(N1,M0) Disease].
• When EBRT to primary is given with ADT in low metastatic burden M1, the
options are LHRH agonist, LHRH antagonist, and orchiectomy.
• Two randomized phase 3 clinical trials of abiraterone with prednisone
plus ADT in patients with castration-sensitive metastatic prostate
cancer demonstrated improved overall survival over ADT alone. Adverse
events were higher with abiraterone and prednisone but were generally
mild in nature and were largely related to mineralocorticoid excess (ie,
hypertension, hypokalemia, edema), hormonal effects (ie, fatigue, hot
flushes), and liver toxicity. Cardiac events, severe hypertension, and liver
toxicity were increased with abiraterone.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY

• A double-blind randomized phase 3 clinical trial of apalutamide plus
ADT in patients with castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer
demonstrated improved overall survival over ADT alone. Adverse events
that were more common with apalutamide than with placebo included rash,
hypothyroidism, and ischemic heart disease.
• An open-label randomized phase 3 clinical trial of enzalutamide plus
ADT in patients with castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer
demonstrated improved overall survival over ADT alone. In a separate
double-blind randomized phase 3 clinical trial, enzalutamide reduced
the risk of metastatic progression or death compared with placebo and
showed an overall survival benefit. Adverse events associated with
enzalutamide included fatigue, seizures, and hypertension.
• A phase 3 trial compared continuous ADT to intermittent ADT, but the
study could not demonstrate non-inferiority for survival. However, qualityof-life measures for erectile function and mental health were better in the
intermittent ADT arm after 3 months of ADT compared to the continuous
ADT arm.
• In addition, three meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials failed to
show a difference in survival between intermittent and continuous ADT.
• Close monitoring of PSA and testosterone levels and possibly imaging
is required when using intermittent ADT, especially during off-treatment
periods, and patients may need to switch to continuous ADT upon signs of
disease progression.
Secondary Hormone Therapy for M0 or M1 CRPC
• Androgen receptor activation and autocrine/paracrine androgen synthesis
are potential mechanisms of recurrence of prostate cancer during ADT
(CRPC). Thus, castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) should be
maintained by continuing LHRH agonist or degarelix while additional
therapies are applied.
• Once the tumor becomes resistant to initial ADT, there are a variety of
options that may afford clinical benefit. The available options are based on
whether the patient has evidence of metastases by conventional imaging,
M0 CRPC vs. M1 CRPC, and whether or not the patient is symptomatic.

• Administration of secondary hormonal therapy can include:
Second-generation antiandrogen
◊ Apalutamide (for M0 and PSADT ≤10 months)
◊ Darolutamide (for M0 and PSADT ≤10 months)
◊ Enzalutamide (for M0 and PSADT ≤10 months or M1)
Androgen metabolism inhibitor
◊ Abiraterone + prednisone (for M1 only)
◊ Fine-particle abiraterone + methylprednisolone (for M1 only)
Other secondary hormone therapy (for M0 or M1)
◊ First-generation antiandrogen (nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide)
◊ Corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, prednisone, or dexamethasone)
◊ Antiandrogen withdrawal
◊ Ketoconazole plus hydrocortisone
• Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid, either prednisone 5
mg PO twice daily for the standard formulation or methylprednisolone 4
mg PO twice daily for the fine-particle formulation.
• A phase 3 study of patients with M0 CRPC and a PSADT ≤10 months
showed apalutamide (240 mg/day) improved the primary endpoint of
metastasis-free survival over placebo (40.5 months vs. 16.2 months). After
a median follow-up of 52 months, final overall survival analysis showed an
improved median overall survival with apalutamide versus placebo (73.9
months vs. 59.9 months). Adverse events included rash (24% vs. 5.5%),
fracture (11% vs. 6.5%), and hypothyroidism (8% vs. 2%). Bone support
should be used in patients receiving apalutamide.
• A phase 3 study of patients with M0 CRPC and a PSADT ≤10 months
showed enzalutamide (160 mg/day) improved the primary endpoint of
metastasis-free survival over placebo (36.6 months vs. 14.7 months).
Median overall survival was longer in the enzalutamide group than in the
placebo group (67.0 months vs. 56.3 months). Adverse events included
falls and nonpathologic fractures (17% vs. 8%), hypertension (12% vs. 5%),
major adverse cardiovascular events (5% vs. 3%), and mental impairment
disorders (5% vs. 2%). Bone support should be used in patients receiving
enzalutamide.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

• A phase 3 study of patients with M0 CRPC and a PSADT ≤10 months

events that occurred more frequently in the treatment arm included fatigue
(12.1% vs. 8.7%), pain in an extremity (5.8% vs. 3.2%), and rash (2.9% vs.
0.9%). The incidence of fractures was similar between darolutamide and
placebo (4.2% vs. 3.6%).
• In a randomized controlled trial in the setting of M1 CRPC prior to
docetaxel chemotherapy, abiraterone and low-dose prednisone (5 mg
BID) compared to prednisone alone improved radiographic progressionfree survival (rPFS), time to initiation of chemotherapy, time to onset or
worsening of pain, and time to deterioration of performance status. An
improvement in overall survival was demonstrated. Use of abiraterone
and prednisone in this setting is a category 1 recommendation. The
side effects of abiraterone that require ongoing monitoring include
hypertension, hypokalemia, peripheral edema, atrial fibrillation, congestive
heart failure, liver injury, and fatigue, as well as the known side effects of
ADT and long-term corticosteroid use.
• A phase 3 study of docetaxel-sensitive patients with M1 CRPC showed that
enzalutamide (160 mg daily) resulted in significant improvement in rPFS
and overall survival. The use of enzalutamide in this setting is category 1.
The side effects of enzalutamide that require long-term monitoring include
fatigue, diarrhea, hot flashes, headache, and seizures (reported in 0.9% of
patients on enzalutamide).
• For symptomatic patients with M1 CRPC, all secondary hormone options
listed above are allowed, but initial use of docetaxel may be preferred.
Both randomized trials of abiraterone and enzalutamide in the predocetaxel setting were conducted in patients who had no or minimal
symptoms due to M1 CRPC. How these agents compare to docetaxel
for pain palliation in this population of patients is not clear. Both drugs
have palliative effects in the post-docetaxel setting. Both abiraterone and
enzalutamide are approved in this pre-docetaxel setting and have category
1 recommendations. Both drugs are suitable options for patients who are
not good candidates to receive docetaxel.
• In the post-docetaxel M1 CRPC population, enzalutamide and abiraterone

plus prednisone have been shown to extend survival in randomized
controlled trials. Therefore, each agent has a category 1 recommendation.
• Two randomized clinical trials (STRIVE and TERRAIN) showed that 160 mg/
day enzalutamide improved PFS compared to 50 mg/day bicalutamide in
patients with treatment-naïve M1 CRPC and, therefore, enzalutamide may
be the preferred option in this setting. However, bicalutamide can still be
considered in some patients, given the different side effect profiles of the
agents and the increased cost of enzalutamide.
• Evidence-based guidance on the sequencing of agents in either pre- or
post-docetaxel remains limited.
ADT for Patients on Observation Who Require Treatment and Those with
Life Expectancy ≤5 Years
• Treatment for patients whose cancer progressed on observation of
localized disease is LHRH agonist or antagonist or orchiectomy.
Optimal ADT
• Medical castration (ie, LHRH agonist or antagonist) and surgical castration
(ie, bilateral orchiectomy) are equally effective.
• Combined androgen blockade (medical or surgical castration combined
with an antiandrogen) provides modest to no benefit over castration alone
in patients with metastatic disease.
• Antiandrogen therapy should precede or be coadministered with LHRH
agonist and be continued in combination for at least 7 days for patients
with overt metastases who are at risk of developing symptoms associated
with the flare in testosterone with initial LHRH agonist alone.
• Antiandrogen monotherapy appears to be less effective than medical or
surgical castration and is not recommended.
• No clinical data support the use of finasteride or dutasteride with combined
androgen blockade.
• Patients who do not achieve adequate suppression of serum testosterone
(<50 ng/dL) with medical or surgical castration can be considered
for additional hormonal manipulations (with antiandrogens, LHRH
antagonists, or steroids), although the clinical benefit remains uncertain.
Consider monitoring testosterone levels 12 weeks after first dose of
LHRH therapy, then upon increase in PSA. The optimal level of serum
testosterone to affect “castration” has yet to be determined.
• Relugolix has not been adequately studied in combination with potent

PRINCIPLES OF ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY

androgen receptor inhibitors such as enzalutamide, apalutamide,
darolutamide, or abiraterone acetate, nor has it been studied in
combination with docetaxel or cabazitaxel chemotherapy. Potential drug
interactions include induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes and reduced
concentration and efficacy of relugolix with enzalutamide or apalutamide
and cardiac QTc interactions with abiraterone. Further studies of relugolix
dosing and drug interactions with commonly used agents in advanced
prostate cancer are needed to ensure patient safety and proper dosing.
• Data are limited on long-term compliance of oral relugolix and the potential
effects on optimal ADT. Ongoing monitoring for sustained suppression of
testosterone (<50 ng/dL) can be considered, and relugolix may not be a
preferred agent if patient compliance is uncertain.
Monitor/Surveillance
• ADT has a variety of adverse effects, including hot flashes, loss of libido,
erectile dysfunction, shrinkage of penis and testicles, loss of muscle
mass and strength, fatigue, anemia, breast enlargement and tenderness/
soreness, depression and mood swings, hair loss, osteoporosis, greater
incidence of clinical fractures, obesity, insulin resistance, alterations
in lipids, and greater risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The
intensity and spectrum of these side effects vary greatly, and many are
reversible or can be avoided or mitigated. For example, physical activity
can counter many of these symptoms and should be recommended
(see NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship). Use of statins also should be
considered. Patients and their medical providers should be advised about
these risks prior to treatment.

• Screening and treatment for osteoporosis are advised according to
guidelines for the general population from the National Osteoporosis
Foundation (www.nof.org). The National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines
include recommendations for: 1) calcium (1000–1200 mg daily from food
and supplements) and vitamin D3 (400–1000 IU daily); and 2) additional
treatment for males aged ≥50 years with low bone mass (T-score between
-1.0 and -2.5, osteopenia) at the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine by
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and a 10-year probability of
hip fracture ≥3% or a 10-year probability of a major osteoporosis-related
fracture ≥20%. Fracture risk can be assessed using FRAX, the algorithm
released by WHO. ADT should be considered “secondary osteoporosis”
when using the FRAX algorithm. Treatment options to increase bone
density, a surrogate for fracture risk in patients without metastases,
include denosumab (60 mg SQ every 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV
annually), and alendronate (70 mg PO weekly).
• A baseline DEXA scan should be obtained before starting therapy in
patients at increased risk for fracture based on FRAX screening. A followup DEXA scan after 1 year of therapy is recommended by the International
Society for Clinical Densitometry, although there is no consensus on the
optimal approach to monitoring the effectiveness of drug therapy. Use of
biochemical markers of bone turnover to monitor response to therapy is
not recommended. The serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and average
daily dietary intake of vitamin D will assist the nutritionist in making a
patient-specific recommendation for vitamin D supplementation. There are
currently no guidelines on how often to monitor vitamin D levels. However,
for those who require monitoring with DEXA scans, it makes sense to
check the serum vitamin D level at the same time.
• Denosumab (60 mg SQ every 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV annually),
and alendronate (70 mg PO weekly) increase bone mineral density, a
surrogate for fracture risk, during ADT for prostate cancer. Treatment
with either denosumab, zoledronic acid, or alendronate sodium is
recommended when the absolute fracture risk warrants drug therapy.
• Screening for and intervention to prevent/treat diabetes and cardiovascular
disease are recommended in patients receiving ADT. These medical
conditions are common in older individuals and it remains uncertain
whether strategies for screening, prevention, and treatment of diabetes
and cardiovascular disease in patients receiving ADT should differ from the
general population.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF NON-HORMONAL SYSTEMIC THERAPY

Non-Hormonal Systemic Therapy for M1 Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
• Patients with high-volume castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer
who are fit for chemotherapy should be considered for ADT plus docetaxel
and either abiraterone or darolutamide based on phase 3 studies:
ADT plus docetaxel and abiraterone improved overall survival and rPFS in
the open-label PEACE-1 study. A modest increase in toxicity was seen.
ADT plus docetaxel and darolutamide improved overall survival in the
ARASENS trial. Adverse events were similar between arms.
The use of myeloid growth factors should follow the NCCN Guidelines for
Hematopoietic Growth Factors, based on risk of neutropenic fever.
Non-Hormonal Systemic Therapy for M1 CRPC
Chemotherapy
• Docetaxel with concurrent steroid
Concurrent steroids may include: dexamethasone on the day of
chemotherapy or daily prednisone.
• Cabazitaxel with concurrent steroid
Concurrent steroids may include: dexamethasone on the day of
chemotherapy or daily prednisone.
• Cabazitaxel/carboplatin with concurrent steroid
Concurrent steroids may include: dexamethasone on the day of
chemotherapy or daily prednisone.
• Mitoxantrone with prednisone
• Every-3-week docetaxel with concurrent steroid is the preferred first-line
chemotherapy treatment based on phase 3 clinical trial data for patients
with symptomatic mCRPC. Radium-223 has been studied in symptomatic
patients who are not candidates for docetaxel-based regimens and
resulted in improved overall survival. Abiraterone and enzalutamide have
been shown to extend survival in patients whose cancer progressed
on docetaxel. (See PROS-I). Mitoxantrone with prednisone may provide
palliation but has not been shown to extend survival.
• Only regimens utilizing docetaxel on an every-3-week schedule
demonstrated beneficial impact on survival. The duration of therapy should
be based on the assessment of benefit and toxicities. In the pivotal trials
establishing survival advantage of docetaxel-based chemotherapy, patients
received up to 10 cycles of treatment if no progression and no prohibitive
toxicities were noted.

• Patients who are not candidates for docetaxel or who are intolerant of
docetaxel should be considered for cabazitaxel with concurrent steroid,
based on recent results that suggest clinical activity of cabazitaxel
in mCRPC. Cabazitaxel was associated with lower rates of peripheral
neuropathy than docetaxel, particularly at 20 mg/m2 (12% vs. 25%) and may
be appropriate in patients with pre-existing mild peripheral neuropathy.
Current data do not support greater efficacy of cabazitaxel over docetaxel.
• Increasing PSA should not be used as the sole criteria for progression.
Assessment of response should incorporate clinical and radiographic
criteria.
• Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m² with concurrent steroid has been shown in a
randomized phase 3 study (TROPIC) to prolong overall survival, PFS, PSA
response, and radiologic response when compared with mitoxantrone and
prednisone and is FDA approved in the post-docetaxel second-line setting.
Toxicity at this dose was significant and included febrile neutropenia,
severe diarrhea, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
sepsis, and renal failure. A recent trial, PROSELICA, compared cabazitaxel
25 mg/m² every 3 weeks to 20 mg/m² every 3 weeks. Cabazitaxel 20 mg/
m² had less toxicity; febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and fatigue were
less frequent. Cabazitaxel at 20 mg/m² had a significantly lower PSA
response rate but non-significantly lower radiographic response rate and
non-significantly shorter PFS and overall survival (13.4 months vs. 14.5
months) compared to 25 mg/m². Cabazitaxel starting dose can be either 20
mg/m² or 25 mg/m² for patients with mCRPC whose cancer has progressed
despite prior docetaxel chemotherapy. Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² with
concurrent steroid may be considered for healthy patients who wish to be
more aggressive. Growth factor support may be needed with either dose.
• Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 with concurrent steroid improved rPFS and
reduced the risk of death compared with abiraterone or enzalutamide in
patients with prior docetaxel treatment for mCRPC in the CARD study.
• Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² plus carboplatin AUC 4 mg/mL per minute with
growth factor support can be considered for fit patients with aggressive
variant prostate cancer (ie, visceral metastases, low PSA and bulky
disease, high LDH, high CEA, lytic bone metastases, NEPC histology) or
unfavorable genomics (defects in at least 2 of PTEN, TP53, and RB1). Corn

PRINCIPLES OF NON-HORMONAL SYSTEMIC THERAPY

• Docetaxel retreatment can be attempted after progression on a novel
hormone therapy in patients with metastatic CRPC whose cancer has not
demonstrated definitive evidence of progression on prior docetaxel therapy
in the castration-sensitive setting.
• No chemotherapy regimen to date has demonstrated improved survival or
quality of life after cabazitaxel, and trial participation should be encouraged.
• Treatment decisions around off-label chemotherapy use in the treatmentrefractory CRPC should be individualized based on comorbidities and
functional status and after informed consent.
• No benefits of combination approaches over sequential single-agent
therapies have been demonstrated, and toxicity is higher with combination
regimens. See NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors for
recommendations on growth factor support.

Targeted Therapy
• Consider inclusion of olaparib in patients who have an HRR mutation
and whose cancer has progressed on prior treatment with androgen
receptor-directed therapy regardless of prior docetaxel therapy. Olaparib
is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic mutation
(germline and/or somatic) in a homologous recombination repair gene
(BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL,
PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L) who have been treated
previously with androgen receptor-directed therapy. However, efficacy
appears to be driven by the cohort of patients with at least one alteration
in BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM, and in particular by patients with BRCA2 or
BRCA1 mutations based on exploratory gene-by-gene analysis. There may
be heterogeneity of response to olaparib for non-BRCA mutations based on
which gene has a the specific gene mutation.
• Consider inclusion of rucaparib for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been treated
with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy.
If the patient is not fit for chemotherapy, rucaparib can be considered even if
taxane-based therapy has not been given.

Immunotherapy
• Patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC may
consider immunotherapy.
• Sipuleucel-T
Sipuleucel-T is only for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic
patients with no liver metastases, life expectancy >6 months, and
ECOG performance status 0–1.
Sipuleucel-T is not recommended for patients with small cell/NEPC.
Sipuleucel-T has been shown in a phase 3 clinical trial to extend mean
survival from 21.7 months in the control arm to 25.8 months in the
treatment arm, which constitutes a 22% reduction in mortality risk.
Sipuleucel-T is well-tolerated; common complications include chills,
pyrexia, and headache.
• Pembrolizumab (for MSI-H, dMMR, or TMB ≥10 mut/Mb)
Pembrolizumab is recommended only as subsequent systemic therapy
for patients with metastatic CRPC whose cancer has progressed
through prior docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

PRINCIPLES OF NON-HORMONAL SYSTEMIC THERAPY
Prevention of Skeletal-Related Events
• In patients with CRPC who have bone metastases, denosumab and zoledronic acid have been shown to prevent disease-related skeletal
complications, which include fracture, spinal cord compression, or the need for surgery or RT to bone.
• When compared to zoledronic acid, denosumab was shown to be superior in prevention of skeletal-related events.
• A phase 3 clinical trial that assessed a role for zoledronic acid in patients beginning ADT for bone metastases was negative.
• Choice of agent may depend on underlying comorbidities, whether the patient has been treated with zoledronic acid previously, logistics, and/or
cost considerations.
Denosumab (preferred) is given SQ every 4 weeks. Although renal monitoring is not required, denosumab is not recommended in patients with
creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. When creatinine clearance is <60 mL/min, the risk for severe hypocalcemia increases. Even in patients with
normal renal function, hypocalcemia is seen twice as often with denosumab than zoledronic acid and all patients on denosumab should be
treated with vitamin D and calcium with periodic monitoring of serum calcium levels.
Zoledronic acid is given IV every 3 to 4 weeks or every 12 weeks. The dose is based on the serum creatinine obtained just prior to each dose and
must be adjusted for impaired renal function. Zoledronic acid is not recommended for creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.
• Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is seen with both agents; risk is increased in patients who have tooth extractions, poor dental hygiene, or a dental
appliance. Patients should be referred for dental evaluation before starting either zoledronic acid or denosumab. If invasive dental procedures are
required, bone-targeted therapy should be withheld until the dentist indicates that the patient has healed completely from all dental procedure(s).
• The optimal duration of therapy for either denosumab or zoledronic acid remains uncertain.
• The toxicity profile of denosumab when denosumab is used in patients who have been treated with zoledronic acid remains uncertain.

Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
Overview
An estimated 248,530 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in
the United States in 2021, accounting for almost 26% of new cancer cases
in males.1 Researchers further estimate that prostate cancer will account
for 10.7% of male cancer deaths in the United States in 2021, with an
estimated 34,130 deaths.1 Over the past several years, the incidence of
prostate cancer has declined, likely in part as a result of decreased
detection attributed to decreased rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
screening.2-4 The age-adjusted death rate from prostate cancer declined
by 52% from 1993 to 2017, but the death rate has become stable in recent
years.1 For all stages combined, the 5-year relative survival rate for
prostate cancer is 98%.1 The comparatively low death rate suggests that
increased public awareness with earlier detection and treatment has
affected mortality from this prevalent cancer, but is also complicated by
screening-related lead-time bias and detection of indolent cancers.
Early detection can lead to overtreatment of prostate cancers that do not
threaten life expectancy, which results in unnecessary side effects that
impair quality of life (QOL) and increase health care expenditures. The
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against
PSA testing in 2012.5 The incidence of metastatic disease has increased
since that time.4,6,7 The rate of prostate cancer mortality, which had been in
decline for 2 decades, has stabilized.1,4 Prostate cancer incidence and
deaths have increased in the past few years for the first time in recent
history, with prostate cancer deaths increasing from an estimated 26,730
in 2017 to 34,130 in 2021.1,8 Increases in the incidence of metastases at
presentation and prostate cancer deaths may be influenced by declines in
the rates of prostate cancer early detection, biopsies, diagnosis of
localized prostate cancers, and radical prostatectomy that followed the
2012 USPSTF recommendations.9-19 The USPSTF released updated
recommendations in 2018 that include individualized, informed decisionmaking regarding prostate cancer screening in males aged 55 to 69

years.20 These updated recommendations may allow for a more balanced
approach to prostate cancer early detection. Better use of PSA for early
detection of potentially fatal prostate cancer coupled with the use of
imaging and biomarkers to improve the specificity of screening (see the
NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection, available at
www.NCCN.org) should decrease the risk of overdetection. This reduced
overdetection along with the use of active surveillance in appropriate
patients should reduce overtreatment AND preserve the decrease in
prostate cancer mortality.

Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update
Methodology
Prior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer, an
electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key
literature in prostate cancer published since the previous Guidelines
update, using the search term “prostate cancer.” The PubMed database
was chosen because it remains the most widely used resource for medical
literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature.21
The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans
published in English. Results were confined to the following article types:
Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Randomized
Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation
Studies.
The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional
sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed by the panel
during the Guidelines update have been included in this version of the
Discussion section. Recommendations for which high-level evidence is
lacking are based on the panel’s review of lower-level evidence and expert
opinion.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN
Guidelines are available at www.NCCN.org.

Initial Prostate Cancer Diagnosis
Initial suspicion of prostate cancer is based on an abnormal digital rectal
exam (DRE) or an elevated PSA level. A separate NCCN Guidelines
Panel has written guidelines for prostate cancer early detection (see the
NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Early Detection, available at
www.NCCN.org). Definitive diagnosis requires biopsies of the prostate,
usually performed by a urologist using a needle under transrectal
ultrasound (TRUS) guidance. A pathologist assigns a Gleason primary
and secondary grade to the biopsy specimen. Clinical staging is based on
the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification from the AJCC Staging
Manual, Eighth Edition.22 NCCN treatment recommendations are based on
risk stratification that includes TNM staging rather than on AJCC
prognostic grouping.
Pathology synoptic reports (protocols) are useful for reporting results from
examinations of surgical specimens; these reports assist pathologists in
providing clinically useful and relevant information. The NCCN Guidelines
Panel favors pathology synoptic reports from the College of American
Pathologists (CAP) that comply with the Commission on Cancer (CoC)
requirements.23

Estimates of Life Expectancy
Estimates of life expectancy have emerged as a key determinant of
primary treatment, particularly when considering active surveillance or
observation. Life expectancy can be estimated for groups of individuals,
but it is difficult to extrapolate these estimates to an individual patient. Life
expectancy can be estimated using the Minnesota Metropolitan Life
Insurance Tables, the Social Security Administration Life Insurance
Tables,24 the WHO’s Life Tables by Country,25 or the Memorial Sloan

Kettering Male Life Expectancy tool26 and adjusted for individual patients
by adding or subtracting 50% based on whether one believes the patient is
in the healthiest quartile or the unhealthiest quartile, respectively.27 As an
example, the Social Security Administration Life Expectancy for a 65-yearold American male is 17.7 years. If judged to be in the upper quartile of
health, a life expectancy of 26.5 years is assigned. If judged to be in the
lower quartile of health, a life expectancy of 8.8 years is assigned. Thus,
treatment recommendations could change dramatically using the NCCN
Guidelines if a 65-year-old patient was judged to be in either poor or
excellent health.

Prostate Cancer Genetics
Family history of prostate cancer raises the risk of prostate cancer.28-31 In
addition, prostate cancer has been associated with hereditary breast and
ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome (due to germline mutations in
homologous DNA repair genes) and Lynch syndrome (resulting from
germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair [MMR] genes).31-36 In fact,
approximately 11% of patients with prostate cancer and at least 1
additional primary cancer carry germline mutations associated with
increased cancer risk.37 Therefore, the panel recommends a thorough
review of personal and family history for all patients with prostate
cancer.38,39
The newfound appreciation of the frequency of germline mutations has
implications for family genetic counseling, cancer risk syndromes, and
assessment of personal risk for subsequent cancers. Some patients with
prostate cancer and their families may be at increased risk for breast and
ovarian cancer, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer (HBOC); colorectal
cancers (Lynch syndrome); and other cancer types. Data also suggest that
patients with prostate cancer who have BRCA1/2 germline mutations have
increased risk of progression on local therapy and decreased overall
survival (OS).40-42 This information should be discussed with such patients

Prostate Cancer
if they are considering active surveillance. Finally, there are possible
treatment implications for patients with DNA repair defects (see Treatment
Options for Patients with DNA Repair Gene Mutations, below).
Prostate cancer is often associated with somatic mutations that occur in
the tumor but not in the germline. An estimated 89% of metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tumors contain a potentially
actionable mutation, with only about 9% of these occurring in the
germline.43 Both germline and tumor mutations are discussed herein.
Homologous DNA Repair Genes
Somatic mutations in DNA repair pathway genes occur in up to 19% of
localized prostate tumors and 23% of metastatic CRPC tumors, with most
mutations found in BRCA2 and ATM.43,44 These tumor mutations are often
associated with germline mutations. For example, 42% of patients with
metastatic CRPC and somatic mutations in BRCA2 were found to carry
the mutation in their germlines.43 In localized prostate cancer, that number
was 60%.44
Overall, germline DNA repair mutations have been reported with the
lowest frequencies seen in patients with lower-risk localized prostate
cancer (1.6%–3.8%), higher frequencies in those with higher-risk localized
disease (6%–8.9%), and the highest frequencies in those with metastatic
disease (7.3%–16.2%).43,45-51 One study found that 11.8% of patients with
metastatic prostate cancer have germline mutations in 1 of 16 DNA repair
genes: BRCA2 (5.3%), ATM (1.6%), CHEK2 (1.9%), BRCA1 (0.9%),
RAD51D (0.4%), PALB2 (0.4%), ATR (0.3%), and NBN, PMS2, GEN1,
MSH2, MSH6, RAD51C, MRE11A, BRIP1, or FAM175A.50

mutation identified was high (28.6%, 2 of 7 patients). Although having a
relative with breast cancer was associated with germline mutation
identification (P = .035), only 45.5% of the mutation carriers in the study
had mutations that were concordant with their personal and family history.
Another study also found that a family history of breast cancer increased
the chances of identifying a germline DNA repair gene mutation in patients
with prostate cancer (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.33–2.68; P = .003).52 In a study
of an unselected cohort of 3607 patients with a personal history of prostate
cancer who had germline genetic testing based on clinician referral, 11.5%
had germline mutations in BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, BRCA1, or PALB2.53
More than 2% of Ashkenazi Jews carry germline mutations in BRCA1 or
BRCA2, and these carriers have a 16% chance (95% CI, 4%–30%) of
developing prostate cancer by the age of 70.54 In a study of 251
unselected Ashkenazi Jewish patients with prostate cancer, 5.2% had
germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, compared with 1.9% of control
Ashkenazi Jewish males.55
Germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have been associated with an
increased risk for prostate cancer in numerous reports.35,36,55-65 In
particular, BRCA2 mutations have been associated with a 2- to 6-fold
increase in the risk for prostate cancer, whereas the association of BRCA1
mutations and increased risks for prostate cancer are less
consistent.35,36,55,57,59,64,66,67 In addition, limited data suggest that germline
mutations in ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2 increase the risk of prostate
cancer.68-71 Furthermore, prostate cancer in individuals with germline
BRCA mutations appears to occur earlier, has a more aggressive
phenotype, and is associated with significantly reduced survival times than
in non-carrier patients.41,42,66,72-76

An additional study showed that 9 of 125 patients with high-risk, very-highrisk, or metastatic prostate cancer (7.2%) had pathogenic germline
mutations in MUTYH (4), ATM (2), BRCA1 (1), BRCA2 (1), and BRIP1
(1).47 In this study, the rate of metastatic disease among those with a

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
DNA Mismatch Repair Genes
Tumor mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 may result in tumor
microsatellite instability (MSI) and deficient MMR (dMMR; detected by
immunohistochemistry) and are sometimes associated with germline
mutations and Lynch syndrome. Patients with Lynch syndrome may have
an increased risk for prostate cancer. In particular, studies show an
increased risk for prostate cancer in patients who are older and have
germline MSH2 mutations.77,78
In a study of more than 15,000 patients with cancer treated at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who had their tumor and matched normal
DNA sequenced and tumor MSI status assessed, approximately 5% of
1048 patients with prostate cancer had MSI-high (MSI-H) or MSIindeterminate tumors, 5.6% of whom were found to have Lynch syndrome
(0.29% of patients with prostate cancer).32 In another prospective case
series, the tumors of 3.1% of 1033 patients with prostate cancer
demonstrated MSI-H/dMMR status, and 21.9% of these patients had
Lynch syndrome (0.68% of the total population).79 In a study of an
unselected cohort of 3607 patients with a personal history of prostate
cancer who had germline genetic testing based on clinician referral, 1.7%
had germline mutations in PMS2, MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6.53
Effect of Intraductal/Cribriform or Ductal Histology
Ductal prostate carcinomas are rare, accounting for approximately 1.3% of
prostate carcinomas.80 Intraductal prostate cancer may be more common,
especially in higher risk groups, and may be associated with a poor
prognosis.81 It is important to note that there is significant overlap in
diagnostic criteria and that intraductal, ductal, and invasive cribriform
features may coexist in the same biopsy. By definition, intraductal
carcinoma includes cribriform proliferation of malignant cells as long as
they remain confined to a preexisting gland that is surrounded by basal
cells. These features are seen frequently with an adjacent invasive

cribriform component and would be missed without the use of basal cell
markers.
Limited data suggest that acinar prostate adenocarcinoma with invasive
cribriform pattern, intraductal carcinoma of prostate (IDC-P), or ductal
adenocarcinoma component y have increased genomic instability.82-85 In
particular, tumors with these histologies may be more likely to harbor
somatic MMR gene alterations than those with adenocarcinoma
histology.85-87 In addition, limited data suggest that germline homologous
DNA repair gene mutations may be more common in prostate tumors of
ductal or intraductal origin88,89 and that intraductal histology is common in
germline BRCA2 mutation carriers with prostate cancer.90 Overall, the
panel believes that the data connecting histology and the presence of
genomic alterations are stronger for intraductal than ductal histology at this
time. Therefore, patients with presence of intraductal carcinoma on biopsy
should have germline testing as described below.
Genetic Testing Recommendations
Germline Testing Based on Family History, Histology, and Risk Groups

The panel recommends inquiring about family and personal history of
cancer and known germline variants at time of initial diagnosis. Germline
testing should be considered in appropriate individuals where it is likely to
impact the prostate cancer treatment and clinical trial options,
management of risk of other cancers, and/or potential risk of cancer in
family members. Based on the data discussed above, the panel
recommends germline genetic testing for patients with prostate cancer and
any of the following38,39:
• A positive family history (see definition in the guidelines above)
• High-risk, very-high-risk, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer,
regardless of family history
• Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry
• A personal history of breast cancer

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
In addition, germline genetic testing should be considered in patients with
a personal history of prostate cancer and 1) intermediate-risk prostate
cancer and intraductal/cribriform histology or 2) a personal history of
exocrine pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal, gastric, melanoma,
pancreatic cancer, upper tract urothelial cancer, glioblastoma, biliary tract
cancer, and small intestinal cancer.

2.

3.
Germline testing, when performed, should include MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
and PMS2 (for Lynch syndrome) and the homologous recombination
genes BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2. Additional genes may
be appropriate depending on clinical context. For example, HOXB13 is a
prostate cancer risk gene and, whereas there are not currently clear
therapeutic implications in the advanced disease setting, testing may have
utility for family counseling.91,92
Genetic counseling resources and support are critical, and post-test
genetic counseling is recommended if a germline mutation (pathogenic
variant) is identified. Cascade testing for relatives is critical to inform the
risk for familial cancers in all relatives. Post-test genetic counseling is
recommended if positive family history but no pathogenic variant OR if
only germline variants of unknown significance (VUS) are identified. This
is to ensure accurate understanding of family implications and review
indications for additional testing and/or follow up (including clinical trials of
reclassification). Resources are available to check the known pathologic
effects of genomic variants (eg, https://brcaexchange.org/about/app;
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/). Information regarding germline
mutations in patients with metastatic disease can be used to inform future
treatments or to determine eligibility for clinical trials.
Somatic Tumor Testing Based on Risk Groups

Tumor testing recommendations are as follows:
1. Tumor testing for somatic homologous recombination gene
mutations (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D,

4.

5.

CHEK2, CDK12) can be considered in patients with regional (N1)
prostate cancer and is recommended for those with metastatic
disease.
Tumor testing for MSI or dMMR can be considered in patients with
regional or metastatic castration-naïve prostate cancer and is
recommended in the metastatic CRPC setting.
Tumor mutational burden (TMB) testing may be considered in
patients with metastatic CRPC.
Multigene molecular testing can be considered for patients with
low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer and life
expectancy ≥10 years (see Tumor Multigene Molecular Testing,
below).
The Decipher molecular assay is recommended to inform adjuvant
treatment if adverse features are found post-radical prostatectomy,
and can be considered as part of counseling for risk stratification in
patients with PSA resistance/recurrence after radical
prostatectomy (category 2B). See Tumor Multigene Molecular
Testing, below).

The panel strongly recommends a metastatic biopsy for histologic and
molecular evaluation. When unsafe or unfeasible, plasma ctDNA assay is
an option, preferably collected during biochemical (PSA) and/or
radiographic progression in order to maximize diagnostic yield. Caution is
needed when interpreting ctDNA-only evaluation due to potential
interference from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP),
which can result in a false-positive biomarker signal.93
If MSI testing is performed, testing using an NGS assay validated for
prostate cancer is preferred.94-96 If MSI-H or dMMR is found, the patient
should be referred for genetic counseling to assess for the possibility of
Lynch syndrome. MSI-H or dMMR indicate eligibility for pembrolizumab for
certain patients with metastatic CRPC (see Pembrolizumab, below).

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
Post-test genetic counseling is recommended if pathogenic/likely
pathogenic somatic mutations in any gene that has clinical implications if
also identified in germline (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2,
MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). Post-test genetic counseling to assess for
the possibility of Lynch syndrome is recommended if MSI-H or dMMR is
found. Virtually none of the NGS tests is designed or validated for
germline assessment. Therefore, over-interpretation of germline findings
should be avoided. If a germline mutation is suspected, the patient should
be recommended for genetic counseling and follow-up dedicated germline
testing.
Additional Testing

Tumors from a majority of patients with metastatic CRPC harbor mutations
in genes involved in the androgen receptor signaling pathway.43 Androgen
receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) testing in circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
can be considered to help guide selection of therapy in the postabiraterone/enzalutamide metastatic CRPC setting (discussed in more
detail below, under AR-V7 Testing).

Risk Stratification for Clinically Localized Disease
Optimal treatment of prostate cancer requires estimation of risk: How likely
is a given cancer to be confined to the prostate or spread to the regional
lymph nodes? How likely is the cancer to progress or metastasize after
treatment? How likely is adjuvant or post-recurrence radiation to control
cancer after an unsuccessful radical prostatectomy?
NCCN and other risk classification schemas are prognostic and have not
been shown to be predictive of benefit to a specific treatment. Thus,
recommendations of when to offer conservative management versus
radical therapy and the use of short-term versus long-term ADT are based
on expert opinion and estimates of absolute benefit and harm from a given
therapy in the context of NCCN risk groups.

There are newer risk classification schemas that have been shown to
outperform NCCN risk groups,97,98 as well as tools (ie, imaging, gene
expression biomarkers, germline testing) that together improve risk
stratification. These tools should not be ordered reflexively. They are
recommended only when they will have the ability to change management
(eg, active surveillance vs. radical treatment). Improved risk stratification
can better identify patients who may derive greater or lesser absolute
benefit from a given treatment.
NCCN Risk Groups
The NCCN Guidelines have, for many years, incorporated a risk
stratification scheme that uses a minimum of stage, Gleason grade, and
PSA to assign patients to risk groups. These risk groups are used to select
the appropriate options that should be considered and to predict the
probability of biochemical recurrence after definitive local therapy.99 Risk
group stratification has been published widely and validated, and provides
a better basis for treatment recommendations than clinical stage
alone.100,101
A new prostate cancer grading system was developed during the 2014
International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus
Conference.102 Several changes were made to the assignment of Gleason
pattern based on pathology. The new system assigns Grade Groups from
1 to 5, derived from the Gleason score.
• Grade Group 1: Gleason score ≤6; only individual discrete wellformed glands
• Grade Group 2: Gleason score 3+4=7; predominantly well-formed
glands with lesser component of poorly formed/fused/cribriform
glands
• Grade Group 3: Gleason score 4+3=7; predominantly poorly
formed/fused/cribriform glands with lesser component of wellformed glands

Many experts believe that ISUP Grade Groups will enable patients to
better understand their true risk level and thereby limit overtreatment. The
new Grade Group system was validated in two separate cohorts, one of
>26,000 patients and one of 5880 patients, treated for prostate cancer
with either radical prostatectomy or radiation.103,104 Both studies found that
Grade Groups predicted the risk of recurrence after primary treatment. For
instance, in the larger study, the 5-year biochemical recurrence-free
progression probabilities after radical prostatectomy for Grade Groups 1
through 5 were 96% (95% CI, 95–96), 88% (95% CI, 85–89), 63% (95%
CI, 61–65), 48% (95% CI, 44–52), and 26% (95% CI, 23–30), respectively.
The separation between Grade Groups was less pronounced in the
radiation therapy (RT) cohort, likely because of increased use of
neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in

the higher risk groups. In another study of the new ISUP Grade Group
system, all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality were
higher in patients in Grade Group 5 than in those in Grade Group 4.105
Additional studies have supported the validity of this new system.106-111 The
NCCN Panel has accepted the new Grade Group system to inform better
treatment discussions compared to those using Gleason score. Patients
remain divided into very-low-, low-, intermediate-, high-, and very-high-risk
groups.
The NCCN Guidelines Panel recognized that heterogeneity exists within
each risk group. For example, an analysis of 12,821 patients showed that
those assigned to the intermediate-risk group by clinical stage (T2b–T2c)
had a lower risk of recurrence than those categorized according to
Gleason score (7) or PSA level (10–20 ng/mL).112 A similar trend of
superior recurrence-free survival was observed in patients placed in the
high-risk group by clinical stage (T3a) compared to those assigned by
Gleason score (8–10) or PSA level (>20 ng/mL), although it did not reach
statistical significance. Other studies have reported differences in
outcomes in the high-risk group depending on risk factors or primary
Gleason pattern.113,114 Evidence also shows heterogeneity in the low-risk
group, with PSA levels and percent positive cores affecting pathologic
findings after radical prostatectomy.115,116
In a retrospective study, 1024 patients with intermediate-risk prostate
cancer were treated with radiation with or without neoadjuvant and
concurrent ADT.117 Multivariate analysis revealed that primary Gleason
pattern 4, number of positive biopsy cores ≥50%, and presence of >1
intermediate-risk factors (IRFs; ie, T2b-c, PSA 10–20 ng/mL, Gleason
score 7) were significant predictors of increased incidence of distant
metastasis. The authors used these factors to separate the patients into
unfavorable and favorable intermediate-risk groups and determined that
the unfavorable intermediate-risk group had worse PSA recurrence-free

Prostate Cancer
survival and higher rates of distant metastasis and prostate cancerspecific mortality than the favorable intermediate-risk group. The use of
active surveillance in patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate
cancer is discussed below (see Active Surveillance in Favorable
Intermediate Risk). The NCCN Panel has included the separation of
intermediate risk group into favorable and unfavorable subsets in their risk
stratification scheme.
Nomograms
The more clinically relevant information that is used in the calculation of
time to PSA recurrence, the more accurate the result. A nomogram is a
predictive instrument that takes a set of input data (variables) and makes
predictions about an outcome. Nomograms predict more accurately for the
individual patient than risk groups, because they combine the relevant
prognostic variables. The Partin tables were the first to achieve
widespread use for counseling patients with clinically localized prostate
cancer.118-121 The tables give the probability (95% CI) that a patient with a
certain clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA will have a cancer of each
pathologic stage. Nomograms can be used to inform treatment decisionmaking for patients contemplating active surveillance,122-124 radical
prostatectomy,125-128 neurovascular bundle preservation129-131 or omission of
pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) during radical prostatectomy,132-135
brachytherapy,125,136-138 or external beam RT (EBRT).125,139 Biochemical
progression-free survival (PFS) can be reassessed postoperatively using
age, diagnostic serum PSA, and pathologic grade and stage.125,140-142
Potential success of adjuvant or post-recurrence RT after unsuccessful
radical prostatectomy can be assessed using a nomogram.125,143
None of the current models predicts with perfect accuracy, and only some
of these models predict metastasis124,125,140,144,145 and cancer-specific
death.126,128,146-148 Given the competing causes of mortality, many patients
who sustain PSA recurrence will not live long enough to develop clinical

evidence of distant metastases or to die from prostate cancer. Those with
a short PSA doubling time (PSADT) are at greatest risk of death. Not all
PSA recurrences are clinically relevant; thus, PSADT may be a more
useful measure of risk of death.149 The NCCN Guidelines Panel
recommends that NCCN risk groups be used to begin the discussion of
options for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer and that
nomograms be used to provide additional and more individualized
information.
Tumor Multigene Molecular Testing
Personalized or precision medicine is a goal for many translational and
clinical investigators. Molecular testing of a tumor offers the potential of
added insight into the “biologic behavior” of a cancer that could thereby aid
in the clinical decision-making. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines
Panel strongly advocates for use of life expectancy estimation,
nomograms, and other clinical parameters such as PSA density as the
foundations for augmented clinical decision-making. Whereas risk groups,
life expectancy estimates, and nomograms help inform decisions,
uncertainty about disease progression persists, and this is where the
prognostic multigene molecular testing can have a role.
Several tissue-based molecular assays have been developed in an effort
to improve decision-making in newly diagnosed patients considering active
surveillance and in treated patients considering adjuvant therapy or
treatment for recurrence. Uncertainty about the risk of disease progression
can be reduced if such molecular assays can provide accurate and
reproducible prognostic or predictive information beyond NCCN risk group
assignment and currently available life expectancy tables and nomograms.
Retrospective case cohort studies have shown that these assays provide
prognostic information independent of NCCN or CAPRA risk groups,
which include likelihood of death with conservative management,
likelihood of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy or EBRT,

Prostate Cancer
likelihood of adverse pathologic features after radical prostatectomy, and
likelihood of developing metastasis after operation, definitive EBRT, or
post-recurrence EBRT.150-162 Evaluation of diagnostic biopsy tissue from
patients enrolled in the Canary PASS multicenter active surveillance
cohort suggested that results of a molecular assay were not associated
with adverse pathology either alone or in combination with clinical
variables.163
Clinical utility studies on the tissue-based molecular assays have also
been performed.164-166 One prospective, clinical utility study of 3966
patients newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer found that the
rates of active surveillance increased with use of a tissue-based gene
expression classifier.164 Active surveillance rates were 46.2%, 75.9%, and
57.9% for those whose classifier results were above the specified
threshold, those whose classifier results were below the threshold, and
those who did not undergo genomic testing, respectively (P < .001). The
authors estimate that one additional patient may choose active
surveillance for every nine patients with favorable-risk prostate cancer who
undergo genomic testing.
Another clinical utility study used two prospective registries of patients with
prostate cancer post-radical prostatectomy (n = 3455).165 Results of
molecular testing with Decipher changed management recommendations
for 39% of patients. This study also evaluated clinical benefit in 102
patients. Those who were classified as high risk by the assay had
significantly different 2-year PSA recurrence rates if they received
adjuvant EBRT versus if they did not (3% vs. 25%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.1;
95% CI, 0.0–0.6; P = .013). No differences in 2-year PSA recurrence were
observed between those who did and did not receive adjuvant therapy in
those classified as low or intermediate risk by the assay. Based on these
results, the panel recommends that the Decipher molecular assay should

be used to inform adjuvant treatment if adverse features are found postradical prostatectomy.
Several of these assays are available, and four have received positive
reviews by the Molecular Diagnostic Services Program (MolDX) and are
likely to be covered by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services).
Several other tests are under development, and the use of these assays is
likely to increase in the coming years.
Table 1 lists these tests in alphabetical order and provides an overview of
each test, populations where each test independently predicts outcome,
and supporting references. These molecular biomarker tests have been
developed with extensive industry support, guidance, and involvement,
and have been marketed under the less rigorous FDA regulatory pathway
for biomarkers. Although full assessment of their clinical utility requires
prospective randomized clinical trials, which are unlikely to be done, the
panel believes that patients with low or favorable intermediate disease and
life expectancy greater than or equal to 10 years may consider the use of
Decipher, Oncotype DX Prostate, or Prolaris during initial risk stratification.
Patients with unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk disease and life
expectancy greater than or equal to 10 years may consider the use of
Decipher or Prolaris. In addition, Decipher may be considered to inform
adjuvant treatment if adverse features are found after radical
prostatectomy and during workup for radical prostatectomy PSA
persistence or recurrence (category 2B for the latter setting). Future
comparative effectiveness research may allow these tests and others like
them to gain additional evidence regarding their utility for better risk
stratification of patients with prostate cancer.

Initial Clinical Assessment and Staging Evaluation
For patients with very-low-, low-, and intermediate-risk prostate cancer
and a life expectancy of 5 years or less and without clinical symptoms,

Prostate Cancer
further imaging and treatment should be delayed until symptoms develop,
at which time imaging can be performed and ADT should be given. Those
with a life expectancy less than or equal to 5 years who fall into the highor very-high-risk categories should undergo bone imaging and, if indicated
by nomogram prediction of lymph node involvement, pelvic +/- abdominal
imaging.
For symptomatic patients and/or those with a life expectancy of greater
than 5 years, bone and soft tissue imaging is appropriate for patients with
unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, and very-high-risk prostate
cancer:
• Bone imaging can be achieved by conventional technetium-99mMDP bone scan.
o Plain films, CT, MRI, or PET/CT or PET/MRI with F-18
sodium fluoride, C-11 choline, F-18 fluciclovine, Ga-68
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-11, or F-18
piflufolastat PSMA can be considered for equivocal results
on initial bone imaging.
• Soft tissue imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include
chest CT and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI.
mpMRI is preferred over CT for pelvic staging.
• Alternatively, Ga-68 PSMA-11 or F-18 piflufolastat PSMA PET/CT
or PET/MRI can be considered for bone and soft tissue (full body)
imaging.
o Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of
PSMA-PET tracers for detecting micrometastatic disease
compared to conventional imaging (CT, MRI) at both initial
staging and biochemical recurrence, the Panel does not
feel that conventional imaging is a necessary prerequisite
to PSMA-PET and that PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI
can serve as an equally effective, if not more effective frontline imaging tool for these patients.

Retrospective evidence suggests that Gleason score and PSA levels are
associated with positive bone scan findings.167 Multivariate analysis of
retrospective data on 643 patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer
who underwent staging CT found that PSA, Gleason score, and clinical T
stage were associated independently with a positive finding (P < .05 for
all).168 mpMRI may detect large and poorly differentiated prostate cancer
(Grade Group ≥2) and detect extracapsular extension (T staging) and is
preferred over CT for abdominal/pelvic staging. mpMRI has been shown to
be equivalent to CT scan for pelvic lymph node evaluation.
See Imaging Techniques below for a more detailed discussion.

Imaging Techniques
Imaging techniques are useful for staging and for detecting metastases
and tumor recurrence. Current clinical imaging techniques for prostate
cancer include conventional radiography (ie, x-rays), ultrasound, CT, MRI,
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT, scintigraphy), and
PET. Some of these modalities have the ability to assess both anatomy
and tumor function/biology. For example, functional MR sequences can be
added to conventional anatomic MR sequences in a clinical examination
such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to assess tumor cellularity or
MR spectroscopy (MRS) to assess tumor metabolism.
Different modalities can also be merged to maximize prostate cancer
assessment. For example, the functional information obtained with PET
can be combined with the spatial and anatomic information with either CT
(ie, PET/CT) or MRI (ie, PET/MRI) to inform about the locations of tumor
foci for diagnosis or therapy response. Another example of the advantage
of combining modalities is MR-ultrasound fusion guided biopsy (eg, MRTRUS) where MRI datasets containing information on suspicious lesions
identified by the radiologist are used by the urologist to navigate
ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate for more accurate diagnosis.169

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
More details on each technique are outlined in the algorithm under
Principles of Imaging.
Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)
The use of mpMRI in the staging and characterization of prostate cancer
has increased in the last few years. mpMRI examinations typically include
three sequences: T2-weighted imaging, DWI, and dynamic contrast
enhancement (DCE) imaging. There has been increased interest in
biparametric imaging that excludes the use of gadolinium contrast in
prostate MRI examinations; however, more data are needed to identify the
risk groups who would benefit most from this approach.170 In general, it is
recommended that mpMRI be performed on a 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic
strength MRI scanner. This is the highest strength scanner in routine
clinical use and provides the best possible evaluation of prostate cancer.
Additional instrumentation can be used, such as an endorectal coil (ERC)
to improve image quality. If a lower strength 1.5T MRI cancer is required
for a patient because of indwelling medical device incompatibility with 3T
MRI, an ERC is recommended. Use of ERC in routine prostate imaging is
controversial. Current data suggest that a 3T exam with ERC may not be
significantly better than a 3T exam without ERC. Moreover, there may not
be a significant difference in image interpretation between a 1.5T with
ERC and 3T without ERC.171 The use of ERC in prostate MRI also
introduces new problems into the clinical workflow including patient
discomfort, prostate distortion, increased scanner time and expense, and
requirement of someone experienced to place the ERC.
Evidence supports the implementation of mpMRI in several aspects of
prostate cancer management.169 First, mpMRI helps detect larger and/or
more poorly differentiated cancers (ie, Grade Group ≥2).172 mpMRI has
been incorporated into MRI-TRUS fusion-targeted biopsy protocols, which
has led to an increase in the diagnosis of high-grade cancers with fewer

biopsy cores, while reducing detection of low-grade and insignificant
cancers.173-175 In fact, a recently published clinical study identified that MRItargeted biopsy synergized with conventional systematic biopsy to identify
more clinically significant cancers.176 Second, mpMRI aids in better
assessment of extracapsular extension (T staging), with high negative
predictive values (NPVs) in patients with low-risk disease.177 mpMRI
results may inform decision-making regarding nerve-sparing operation.178
Third, mpMRI is equivalent to CT scan for staging of pelvic lymph
nodes.179,180 Finally, mpMRI outperforms bone scan and targeted x-rays for
detection of bone metastases, with a sensitivity of 98% to 100% and
specificity of 98% to 100% (vs. sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 98%–
100% for bone scan plus targeted x-rays).181
PET Imaging
The use of PET/CT or PET/MRI imaging using tracers other than F-18
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for staging of small-volume recurrent or
metastatic prostate cancer has rapidly expanded in recent years.169
Currently, there are five PET tracers that are FDA approved for use in
patients with prostate cancer: Ga-68 PSMA-11 (PSMA-HBED-CC), F-18
piflufolastat (DCFPyL), C-11 choline, F-18 fluciclovine, and F-18 sodium
fluoride. Although these tracers are approved for the evaluation of patients
with biochemical recurrence, the PSMA tracers Ga-68 PSMA-11 and F-18
piflufolastat are also approved for patients at initial staging with suspected
metastatic disease. Tracer distribution in patients with prostate cancer can
be imaged with either PET/CT or PET/MRI modalities. Although CT and
MRI are equivalent in the assessment of lymphadenopathy, PET/MRI has
the added advantage over PET/CT with enhanced tissue contrast that is
especially important in evaluation of pelvic anatomy and prostate cancer
assessment. Table 2 summarizes the FDA-cleared PET imaging tracers
studied in prostate cancer. F-18 FDG PET should not be used routinely,
because data are limited in patients with prostate cancer and suggest that

Prostate Cancer
its sensitivity is significantly lower than that seen with the above described
tracers.182-184
PSMA-PET refers to a growing body of radiopharmaceuticals that target
prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on the surface of prostate
cells. Because of the high density of PSMA receptors on the surface of
cancer cells relative to adjacent prostate, PSMA-PET has the advantage
of high signal-to-noise relative to adjacent tissues. The mechanistic role of
androgen receptor signaling in PSMA regulation is still being investigated,
as multiple reports in animals and humans suggest that androgen
modulation can affect PSMA expression and may even be dichotomous in
patients with castration-naïve versus castrate-resistant disease.185-187
There are multiple PSMA radiopharmaceuticals at various stages of
investigation. At this time, the NCCN Guidelines only recommend two
PSMA tracers: the currently FDA-approved PSMA agents, F-18
piflufolastat and Ga-68 PSMA-11. F-18 piflufolastat PSMA or Ga-68
PSMA-11 PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered as an alternative to
standard imaging of bone and soft tissue for initial staging, the detection of
biochemically recurrent disease, and as workup for progression with bone
scan plus CT or MRI for the evaluation of bone, pelvis, and abdomen.
Studies suggest that PSMA PET imaging has a higher sensitivity than C11 choline or F-18 fluciclovine PET imaging, especially at very low PSA
levels.188-193 The reported sensitivity and specificity for PSMA-11 PET/CT in
the detection of nodal involvement in primary staging of patients with
intermediate-, high-, and very-high-risk disease is 40% and 95%,
respectively.194 The patient-level positive predictive value (PPV) in
detection of lesions in patients with BCR is 92%.195 Similarly, the reported
sensitivity and specificity for piflufolastat PET/CT in the detection of nodal
involvement in primary staging of patients with unfavorable intermediate-,
high-, and very-high-risk disease is 31% to 42% and 96% to 99%,
respectively.196,197 The patient-level correct localization rate (CLR; patient-

level PPV validated by anatomic lesion co-localization) for piflufolastat
PET/CT is 85% to 87%.198 Thus, PSMA-11 and piflufolastat are considered
equivalent. Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of PSMA
PET tracers for detecting micrometastatic disease compared to
conventional imaging (CT, MRI) at both initial staging and biochemical
recurrence, the Panel does not feel that conventional imaging is a
necessary prerequisite to PSMA-PET and that PSMA PET/CT or PSMAPET/MRI can serve as an equally effective, if not more effective front-line
imaging tool for these patients.
PET/CT or PET/MRI detect small-volume disease in bone and soft
tissues.199,200 The reported sensitivity and specificity of C-11 choline
PET/CT in restaging patients with biochemical recurrence ranges from
32% to 93% and from 40% to 93%, respectively.201-210 The reported
sensitivity and specificity of F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT ranges from 37% to
90% and from 40% to 100%, respectively.207,211,212 A prospective study
compared F-18 fluciclovine and C-11 choline PET/CT scans in 89 patients,
and agreement was 85%.207 Thus, choline and fluciclovine are considered
equivalent in the evaluation of patients with biochemical recurrence. The
panel believes that F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT or PET/MRI or C-11 choline
PET/CT or PET/MRI may be used in patients with biochemical recurrence
after primary treatment for further soft tissue and/or bone evaluation after
bone scan, chest CT, and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI.
The use of these PET tracers can lead to changes in clinical management.
The FALCON trial showed that results of F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT in 104
patients with biochemical recurrence after definitive therapy resulted in a
change in management for 64%.213 In addition, the LOCATE trial
demonstrated that fluciclovine frequently changed management plans in
patients with biochemical recurrence.214 In a similar fashion, data also
show that PSMA PET has the ability to change radiation treatment
planning in 53% (N = 45) of patients with high- and very-high-risk prostate

cancer using PSMA-11 as well as change management in over half of a
prospective cohort of 635 patients with BCR.215,216 However, whether
changes to treatment planning because of PET tracers have an impact on
long-term survival remains to be studied.
F-18 sodium fluoride targets osteoblast activity where the fluoride is
deposited into new bone formation, thus limiting use of this agent to the
detection of osseous metastases. Fluoride PET/CT has greater sensitivity
than standard bone scintigraphy in the detection of bone metastases, with
77% to 94% sensitivity, 92% to 99% specificity, and 82% to 97% PPV.217
However, emerging evidence indicates that other tracers such as PSMA
are at least equivalent to fluoride in the detection of osseous metastases
with the added advantage of soft tissue metastasis detection.218
The Panel believes that bone imaging can be achieved by conventional
technetium-99m-MDP bone scan. Plain films, CT, MRI, or PET/CT or
PET/MRI with F-18 sodium fluoride, C-11 choline, F-18 fluciclovine, Ga-68
PSMA-11, or F-18 piflufolastat PSMA can be considered for equivocal
results on initial bone imaging. Alternatively, Ga-68 PSMA-11 or F-18
piflufolastat PSMA PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered for bone and
soft tissue (full body) imaging. 219-222
Histologic or radiographic confirmation of involvement detected by PET
imaging is recommended whenever feasible due to the presence of false
positives. Although false positives exist, literature suggests that these are
outweighed by the increase in true positives detected by PET relative to
bone scintigraphy. To reduce the false-positive rate, physicians should
consider the intensity of PSMA-PET uptake and correlative CT findings in
the interpretation of scans. Several reporting systems have been proposed
but will not have been validated or widely used.223,224 Moreover, although
PET imaging may change treatment,214 it may not change oncologic
outcome. Earlier detection of bone metastatic disease, for instance, may

result in earlier use of newer and more expensive therapies, which may
not improve oncologic outcomes or OS.
Risks of Imaging
As with any medical procedure, imaging is not without risk. Some of these
risks are concrete and tangible, while others are less clear. Risks
associated with imaging include exposure to ionizing radiation, adverse
reaction to contrast media, false-positive scans, and overdetection.
Exposure to Ionizing Radiation

Deterministic and stochastic are two types of effects from exposure to
ionizing radiation by x-ray, CT, or PET/CT. Deterministic effects are those
that occur at a certain dose level, and include events such as cataracts
and radiation burns. No effect is seen below the dose threshold. Medical
imaging is always performed almost below the threshold for deterministic
effects. Stochastic effects tend to occur late, increase in likelihood as dose
increases, and have no known lower “safe” limit. The major stochastic
effect of concern in medical imaging is radiation-induced malignancy.
Unfortunately, no direct measurements are available to determine risk of
cancer arising from one or more medical imaging events, so risks are
calculated using other models (such as from survivors of radiation
exposure). The literature is conflicting with regard to the precise risk of
secondary malignancies in patients undergoing medical imaging
procedures. There is a small but finite risk of developing secondary
malignancies as a result of medical imaging procedures, and the risk is
greatest in young patients. However, the absolute risk of fatal malignancy
arising from a medical imaging procedure is very low, and is difficult to
detect given the prevalence of cancer in the population and the multiple
factors that contribute to oncogenesis.225 Efforts should be made to
minimize dose from these procedures, which begin with judicious use of
imaging only when justified by the clinical situation. Harm may arise from

Prostate Cancer
not imaging a patient, through disease non-detection, or from erroneous
staging.
Adverse Reaction to Contrast Media

Many imaging studies make use of contrast material delivered by oral,
intravenous, or rectal routes. The use of contrast material may improve
study performance, but reactions to contrast material may occur and they
should be used only when warranted. Some patients develop adverse
reactions to iodinated intravenous contrast material. Most reactions are
mild cutaneous reactions (eg, urticaria, pruritus) but occasionally severe
reactions can be life-threatening (bronchospasm or anaphylaxis). The risk
of severe reaction is low with non-ionic contrast materials.226 Both
iodinated CT contrast material and gadolinium-based MR contrast
materials can be problematic in patients with reduced renal function.
Gadolinium MR contrast media, in particular, is contraindicated in patients
with acute renal failure or stage V chronic kidney disease (glomerular
filtration rate [GFR] <15).227 Patients in this category are significantly more
likely to develop nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Centers performing
imaging studies with contrast materials should have policies in place to
address the use of contrast in these patients.
False-Positive Scans and Overdetection

Every imaging test has limitations for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
that involve both the nature of the imaging modality as well as the
interpreting physician. Harm can arise when a tumor or tumor recurrence
is not detected (ie, false negative), but harm to the patient and added
expense to the medical system also can result from false-positive scans.
Extensive workup of imaging findings that may otherwise be benign or
indolent (ie, overdetection) can lead to significant patient anxiety,
additional and unnecessary imaging, and invasive procedures that carry
their own risks for adverse outcomes.

Accurate and medically relevant interpretation of imaging studies requires
familiarity and expertise in the imaging modality, attention to detail in
image review, knowledge of tumor biology, and familiarity with treatment
options and algorithms. Challenging cases are best addressed through
direct communication, either physician-to-physician or in a multidisciplinary
tumor board setting.
Medical imaging is a critical tool in the evaluation and management of
patients with malignancy. However, as with any medical procedure,
imaging is not without risks to patients. Inappropriate use of imaging also
has been identified as a significant contributor to health care costs in the
United States and worldwide. Therefore, imaging should be performed
only when medically appropriate, and in a manner that reduces risk (eg,
minimizing radiation dose). An algorithmic approach to the use of imaging,
such as by NCCN and the Appropriateness Criteria developed by the
American College of Radiology,228 can assist in medical decision-making.

Observation
Observation involves monitoring the course of prostate cancer with a
history and physical exam no more often than every 12 months (without
surveillance biopsies) until symptoms develop or are thought to be
imminent. If patients under observation become symptomatic, an
assessment of disease burden can be performed, and treatment or
palliation can be considered. Observation thus differs from active
surveillance. The goal of observation is to maintain QOL by avoiding
noncurative treatment when prostate cancer is unlikely to cause mortality
or significant morbidity. The main advantage of observation is avoidance
of possible side effects of unnecessary definitive therapy or ADT.
However, patients may develop urinary retention or pathologic fracture
without prior symptoms or increasing PSA level.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
Observation is applicable to patients who are older or frail with comorbidity
that will likely out-compete prostate cancer for cause of death. Johansson
and colleagues229 observed that only 13% of patients developed
metastases 15 years after diagnosis of T0–T2 disease and only 11% had
died from prostate cancer. Because prostate cancer will not be treated for
cure for patients with shorter life expectancies, observation for as long as
possible is a reasonable option based on physician discretion. Monitoring
should include PSA and physical exam no more often than every 6
months, but will not involve surveillance biopsies or radiographic imaging.
When symptoms develop or are imminent, patients can begin palliative
ADT.

Active Surveillance
Active surveillance (formerly referred to as watchful waiting, expectant
management, or deferred treatment) involves actively monitoring the
course of the disease with the expectation to deliver curative therapy if the
cancer progresses. Unlike observation, active surveillance is mainly
applicable to younger patients with seemingly indolent cancer with the
goal to defer or avoid treatment and its potential side effects. Because
these patients have a longer life expectancy, they should be followed
closely and treatment should start promptly should the cancer progress so
as not to miss the chance for cure.
Several large active surveillance cohort studies have shown that between
50% and 68% of those eligible for active surveillance may safely avoid
treatment, and thus the possible associated side effects of treatment, for
at least 10 years.230-232 For example, in one study, 55% of the population
remained untreated at 15 years.231 Although a proportion of patients on
active surveillance will eventually undergo treatment, the delay does not
appear to impact cure rates, and numerous studies have shown that active
surveillance can be a safe option for many patients.230-240 In fact, a 2015
meta-analysis of 26 active surveillance cohort studies that included 7627

patients identified only 8 prostate cancer deaths and 5 cases of
metastasis.241
Further, the ProtecT study, which randomized 1643 patients with localized
prostate cancer to active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, or RT, found
no significant difference in the primary outcome of prostate cancer
mortality at a median of 10 years follow-up.242 Of 17 prostate cancer
deaths (1% of study participants), 8 were in the active surveillance group,
5 were in the operation group, and 4 were in the radiation group (P = .48
for the overall comparison). However, a 12.2% absolute increase in the
rate of disease progression and a 3.4% absolute increase in the rate of
metastases or prostate cancer death were seen in the active surveillance
group.242,243 Approximately 23% of participants had Gleason scores 7–10,
and 5 of 8 deaths in the active surveillance group were in this subset.
Patient-reported outcomes were compared among the 3 groups.244 The
operation group experienced the greatest negative effect on sexual
function and urinary continence, whereas bowel function was worst in the
radiation group.
In addition, studies have shown that active surveillance does not adversely
impact psychological well-being or QOL.244-249
The proportion of patients with low-risk prostate cancer choosing active
surveillance in the Veterans Affairs Integrated Health Care System
increased from 2005 to 2015: from 4% to 39% of those younger than 65
years and from 3% to 41% of those ≥65 years.250 An analysis of the SEER
database found a similar trend, with the use of active surveillance in
patients with low-risk prostate cancer increasing from 14.5% in 2010 to
42.1% in 2015.251 An international, hospital-based, retrospective analysis
of greater than 115,000 patients with low-risk prostate cancer reported that
active surveillance utilization increased, but the proportions were lower at
7% in 2010 and 20% in 2014.252

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
Ultimately, a recommendation for active surveillance must be based on
careful individualized weighing of a number of factors: life expectancy,
general health condition, disease characteristics, potential side effects of
treatment, and patient preference. Shared decision-making, after
appropriate counseling on the risks and benefits of the various options, is
critical.
The panel believes there is an urgent need for further clinical research
regarding the criteria for recommending active surveillance, the criteria for
reclassification on active surveillance, and the schedule for active
surveillance especially as it pertains to prostate biopsies, which pose an
increasing burden. One important ongoing study that can help answer
these questions is the prospective multi-institutional Canary PASS cohort
study, which has been funded by the NCI.237 Nine hundred five patients,
median age 63 years and median follow-up 28 months, demonstrated 19%
conversion to therapy. Much should be learned about the criteria for
selection of and progression on active surveillance as this cohort and
research effort mature.
Rationale
The NCCN Guidelines Panel remains concerned about the problems of
overtreatment related to the increased frequency of diagnosis of prostate
cancer from widespread use of PSA for early detection or screening (see
the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection, available at
www.NCCN.org).
The debate about the need to diagnose and treat every individual who has
prostate cancer is fueled by the high prevalence of prostate cancer upon
autopsy of the prostate253; the high frequency of positive prostate biopsies
in individuals with normal DREs and serum PSA values254; the contrast
between the incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer; and the
need to treat an estimated 37 patients with screen-detected prostate

cancer255,256 or 100 patients with low-risk prostate cancer257 to prevent one
death from the disease. The controversy regarding overtreatment of
prostate cancer and the value of prostate cancer early detection255-261 has
been further informed by publication of the Goteborg study, a subset of the
European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer
(ERSPC).262,263 Many believe that this study best approximates proper use
of PSA for early detection because it was population-based and involved a
1:1 randomization of 20,000 participants who received PSA every 2 years
and used thresholds for prostate biopsy of PSA >3 and >2.5 since 2005.
The 14-year follow-up reported in 2010 was longer than the European
study as a whole (9 years) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and
Ovarian (PLCO) trial (11.5 years). Prostate cancer was diagnosed in
12.7% of the screened group compared to 8.2% of the control group.
Prostate cancer mortality was 0.5% in the screened group and 0.9% in the
control group, which gave a 40% absolute cumulative risk reduction of
prostate cancer death (compared to ERSPC 20% and PLCO 0%).262 Most
impressively, 40% of the patients were initially managed using active
surveillance and 28% were still on active surveillance at the time these
results were analyzed. To prevent a prostate cancer death, 12 individuals
would need to be diagnosed and treated as opposed to the ERSPC as a
whole where 37 individuals needed to be treated. Analysis of 18-year
follow-up data from the Goteborg study reduced the number needed to be
diagnosed to prevent 1 prostate cancer death to 10.264 Thus, early
detection, when applied properly, should reduce prostate cancer mortality.
However, that reduction comes at the expense of overtreatment that may
occur in as many as 50% of patients treated for PSA-detected prostate
cancer.265
The best models of prostate cancer detection and progression estimate
that 23% to 42% of all U.S. screen-detected cancers were overtreated266
and that PSA detection was responsible for up to 12.3 years of lead-time
bias.267 The NCCN Guidelines Panel responded to these evolving data

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
with careful consideration of which patients should be recommended
active surveillance. However, the NCCN Guidelines Panel recognizes the
uncertainty associated with the estimation of chance of competing causes
of death; the definition of very-low-, low-, and favorable intermediate-risk
prostate cancer; the ability to detect disease progression without
compromising chance of cure; and the chance and consequences of
treatment side effects.
Patient Selection
Epstein and colleagues268 introduced clinical criteria to predict
pathologically “insignificant” prostate cancer. Insignificant, or very-low-risk,
prostate cancer is identified by: clinical stage T1c, biopsy Grade Group 1,
the presence of disease in fewer than 3 biopsy cores, ≤50% prostate
cancer involvement in any core, and PSA density <0.15 ng/mL/g. Despite
the usefulness of these criteria, physicians are cautioned against using
these as the sole decision maker. Studies have shown that as many as
8% of cancers that qualified as insignificant using the Epstein criteria were
not organ-confined based on postoperative findings.269,270 A new
nomogram may be better.271 Although many variations upon this definition
have been proposed (reviewed by Bastian and colleagues272), a
consensus of the NCCN Guidelines Panel was reached that insignificant
prostate cancer, especially when detected early using serum PSA, poses
little threat to individuals with a life expectancy of less than 20 years. The
confidence that Americans with very-low-risk prostate cancer have a very
small risk of prostate cancer death is enhanced by lead time bias
introduced by PSA early detection that ranges from an estimated 12.3
years in a 55-year-old individual to 6 years in a 75-year-old individual.267
At this time, the NCCN Panel consensus is that active surveillance is
preferred for all patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer and life
expectancy greater than 10 years.

Active Surveillance in Low-Risk Disease

Panel consensus is that active surveillance is preferred for most patients
with low-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy greater than or equal to
10 years. However, the panel recognizes that there is heterogeneity
across the low-risk group, and that some factors may be associated with
an increased probability of near-term grade reclassification including high
PSA density, a high number of positive cores (eg, ≥3), high genomic risk
(from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis), and/or a known BRCA2
germline mutation.273-275 Of note, core involvement in the major active
surveillance cohort studies was generally low (see Table 1 in the
Principles of Active Surveillance and Observation, in the algorithm above).
Therefore, in some of patients with low-risk prostate cancer, upfront
treatment with radical prostatectomy or prostate RT may be preferred
based on shared decision-making with the patient.
Active Surveillance in Favorable Intermediate-Risk Disease

The literature on outcomes of active surveillance in patients with
intermediate-risk prostate cancer is limited.276 In the PIVOT trial, patients
with clinically localized prostate cancer and a life expectancy greater than
or equal to 10 years were randomized to radical prostatectomy or
observation.277 Of the 120 participants with intermediate-risk disease who
were randomized to observation, 13 died from prostate cancer, a nonsignificant difference compared with 6 prostate cancer deaths in 129
participants with intermediate-risk disease in the radical prostatectomy
arm (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.21–1.21; P = .12). After longer follow-up
(median 12.7 years), a small difference was seen in all-cause mortality in
those with intermediate-risk disease (absolute difference, 14.5 percentage
points; 95% CI, 2.8–25.6), but not in those with low-risk disease (absolute
difference, 0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -10.5–11.8).278 Urinary
incontinence and erectile and sexual dysfunction, however, were worse
through 10 years in the radical prostatectomy group. These results and the

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
less-than-average health of participants in the PIVOT study279 suggest that
patients with competing risks may safely be offered active surveillance.
Other prospective studies of active surveillance that included patients with
intermediate-risk prostate cancer resulted in favorable prostate cancerspecific survival rates of 94% to 100% for the full cohorts.231,234,235
However, with extended follow-up, the Toronto group has demonstrated
inferior metastasis-free survival for patients with intermediate-risk prostate
cancer (15-year metastasis-free survival for cases of Gleason 6 or less
with PSA <10 ng/mL, 94%; Gleason 6 or less with PSA 10–20 ng/mL,
94%; Gleason 3+4 with PSA 20 ng/mL or less, 84%; and Gleason 4+3
with PSA 20 ng/mL or less, 63%).280
Overall, the Panel interpreted these data to show that a subset of patients
with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy
greater than 10 years may be considered for active surveillance. However,
the precise inclusion criteria and follow-up protocols need continued
refinement. Patients must understand that a significant proportion of those
clinically staged as having favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer may
have higher risk disease.281-284 Particular consideration to active
surveillance may be appropriate for those patients with a low percentage
of Gleason pattern 4 cancer, low tumor volume, low PSA density, and/or
low genomic risk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis), but should
be approached with caution, include informed decision-making, and use
close monitoring for progression.
Role of Race in Decisions Regarding Active Surveillance

Race is emerging as an important factor to consider when contemplating
active surveillance, particularly for African-American patients. A CDC
analysis of population-based cancer registries found that from 2003 to
2017, the incidence of prostate cancer was higher in black individuals than
in white individuals, Hispanic individuals, American Indian/Alaska natives,
and Asian/Pacific islanders.285 Five-year survival for all stages combined

was higher for white patients than for black or Hispanic patients, but
survival for distant stage disease was higher for black patients than white
patients. In an analysis that spanned 2010 to 2012, African Americans had
a higher lifetime risk of developing (18.2% vs. 13.3%) and dying from
(4.4% vs. 2.4%) prostate cancer compared to Caucasian Americans.286 In
one study, the increase in prostate-cancer-specific mortality in African
American patients was limited to those with grade group 1.287 Multiple
studies have shown that African Americans with very-low-risk prostate
cancer may harbor high-grade (Grade Group ≥2) cancer that is not
detected by pre-treatment biopsies. Compared to Caucasian Americans
matched on clinical parameters, African Americans have been reported to
have a 1.7- to 2.3-fold higher change of pathologic upgrading.288,289
However, other studies have not seen different rates of upstaging or
upgrading.290,291 For example, in a retrospective study of 895 patients in the
SEARCH database, no significant differences were seen in the rates of
pathologic upgrading, upstaging, or biochemical recurrence between
African American and Caucasian Americans.290
Several studies have reported that, among patients with low-risk prostate
cancer who are enrolled in active surveillance programs, African
Americans have higher risk of disease progression to higher Gleason
grade or volume cancer than Caucasian Americans.292-295 African
Americans in the low- to intermediate-risk categories also appear to suffer
from an increased risk of biochemical recurrence after treatment.296 In
addition, African American patients with low-risk or favorable intermediaterisk prostate cancer have an increase in all-cause mortality after
treatment, mainly due to cardiovascular complications after ADT.297
Reasons for these clinical disparities are under investigation, but treatment
disparities and access to health care may play a significant role.298,299 In
fact, results of some studies suggest that racial disparities in prostate
cancer outcomes are minimized when health care access is equal.300-303

Prostate Cancer
Strategies to improve risk-stratification for African Americans considering
active surveillance may include mpMRI in concert with targeted imageguided biopsies, which have been reported to improve detection of
clinically significant tumors in some individuals.304

PSA-based bloodwork, and/or molecular tumor analysis. However, all
patients should undergo a confirmatory prostate biopsy within 1 to 2 years
of their diagnostic biopsy.
Active Surveillance Program

Confirmatory Testing
Confirmatory testing can help facilitate early identification of those patients
who may be at a higher risk of future grade reclassification or cancer
progression. Since an initial prostate biopsy may underestimate tumor
grade or volume, confirmatory testing is strongly recommended within the
first 6 to 12 months of diagnosis for patients who are considering active
surveillance.
Before starting on an active surveillance program, mpMRI with calculation
of PSA density should be considered to confirm candidacy for active
surveillance if not performed during initial workup.305 Patients with PIRADS 4 or 5 on mpMRI have an increased risk of biopsy progression
during active surveillance.306
In patients with low and favorable intermediate risk, molecular tumor
analysis can also be considered before deciding whether to pursue active
surveillance (see Tumor Multigene Molecular Testing, above). One study
examined the role of molecular tumor analysis for predicting upgrading on
surveillance biopsy or the presence of adverse pathology on eventual
radical prostatectomy in patients in an active surveillance cohort.163 In this
study, results of the molecular testing did not significantly improve risk
stratification over the use of clinical variables alone.
If results of mpMRI and/or molecular testing are concerning, a repeat
biopsy may be appropriate.
Early confirmatory testing may not be necessary in patients who have had
a complete workup including mpMRI prior to diagnostic biopsy, advanced

The current NCCN recommendations for the active surveillance program
include PSA no more often than every 6 months unless clinically indicated;
DRE no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated;
repeat prostate biopsy no more often than every 12 months unless
clinically indicated; and repeat mpMRI no more often than every 12
months unless clinically indicated. Repeat molecular tumor analysis is
discouraged during active surveillance. Results of a study of 211 patients
with Grade Group 1 prostate cancer who had initial and repeat mpMRIs
and PSA monitoring suggest that a negative initial mpMRI predicts a low
risk of Gleason upgrading by systematic biopsy.307 In addition, PSA
velocity was significantly associated with subsequent progression in those
with an initial negative mpMRI. In contrast, those with high-risk visible
lesions on mpMRI before initiation of active surveillance had an increased
risk of progression. A meta-analysis of 43 studies found the sensitivity and
NPV for mpMRI to be 0.81 and 0.78, respectively.308 An analysis of
patients in Canary PASS found that mpMRI had an NPV and PPV for
detecting Grade Group ≥2 cancer of 83% and 31%, respectively.309
Another study found the NPV of mpMRI to be 80%.310
Whereas the intensity of surveillance may be tailored on an individual
basis (eg, based on life expectancy and risk of reclassification), most
patients should have prostate biopsies incorporated as part of their
monitoring, but no more often than every 12 months, because PSA
kinetics may not be reliable for predicting progression. Repeat biopsy is
useful to determine whether higher Gleason grade exists, which may
influence prognosis and hence the decision to continue active surveillance
or proceed to definitive local therapy.311 A repeat prostate biopsy should

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
also be considered if the prostate exam changes, if mpMRI (if done)
suggests more aggressive disease, or if PSA increases. However,
literature suggests that as many as 7% of patients undergoing prostate
biopsy will suffer an adverse event,259 and those who develop urinary tract
infection are often fluoroquinolone-resistant.312 Radical prostatectomy may
become technically challenging after multiple sets of biopsies, especially
as it pertains to potency preservation.313 Therefore, many clinicians choose
to wait 2 years for a biopsy if there are no signs of progression.
If the PSA level increases and systematic prostate biopsy remains
negative, mpMRI may be considered to exclude the presence of anterior
cancer.314
In patients with a suspicious lesion on mpMRI, MRI-US fusion biopsy
improves the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥2) cancers. Early
experience supports the utilization of mpMRI in biopsy protocols to better
risk stratify patients under active surveillance.315-317 However, more recent
studies have shown that a significant proportion of high-grade cancers are
detected with systematic biopsy and not targeted biopsy in patients on
active surveillance.318-320
Patients should be transitioned to observation (see Observation, above)
when life expectancy is less than 10 years.
Considerations for Treatment of Patients on Active Surveillance
Reliable parameters of prostate cancer progression await the results of
ongoing clinical trials. PSADT is not considered reliable enough to be used
alone to detect disease progression.321 If repeat biopsy shows Grade
Group ≥3 disease, or if tumor is found in a greater number of biopsy cores
or in a higher percentage of a given biopsy core, cancer progression may
have occurred. Grade reclassification on repeat biopsy is the most
common factor influencing a change in management from active
surveillance to treatment. Other factors affecting decisions to actively treat

include: increase in tumor volume, a rise in PSA density, as well as patient
anxiety. Considerations for a change in management strategy should be
made in the context of the patient’s life expectancy.
Each of the major active surveillance series has used different criteria for
reclassification.230,231,236-239,322-325 Reclassification criteria were met by 23%
of patients with a median follow-up of 7 years in the Toronto experience,323
36% of patients with a median follow-up of 5 years in the Johns Hopkins
experience,230 and 16% of patients with a median follow-up of 3.5 years in
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) experience239 (Table 3).
Uncertainty regarding reclassification criteria and the desire to avoid
missing an opportunity for cure drove several reports that dealt with the
validity of commonly used reclassification criteria. The Toronto group
demonstrated that a PSA trigger point of PSADT less than 3 years could
not be improved upon by using a PSA threshold of 10 or 20, PSADT
calculated in various ways, or PSA velocity greater than 2 ng/mL/y.326 The
Johns Hopkins group used biopsy-demonstrated reclassification to
Gleason pattern 4 or 5 or increased tumor volume on biopsy as their
criteria for reclassification. Of 290 patients on an annual prostate biopsy
program, 35% demonstrated reclassification at a median follow-up of 2.9
years.327 Neither PSADT (area under the curve [AUC], 0.59) nor PSA
velocity (AUC, 0.61) was associated with prostate biopsy reclassification.
Both groups have concluded that PSA kinetics cannot replace regular
prostate biopsy, although treatment of most patients who demonstrate
reclassification on prostate biopsy prevents evaluation of biopsy
reclassification as a criterion for treatment or reduction of survival.
Treatment of all patients who developed Gleason pattern 4 on annual
prostate biopsies has thus far resulted in only 2 prostate cancer deaths
among 1298 patients (0.15%) in the Johns Hopkins study.230 However, it
remains uncertain whether treatment of all who progressed to Gleason
pattern 4 was necessary. Studies remain in progress to identify the best

Prostate Cancer
trigger points when interventions with curative intent may still be
successful.
The Toronto group published findings on three patients who died of
prostate cancer in their experience with 450 patients on active
surveillance.323 These three deaths led them to revise their criteria for
offering active surveillance, because each of these three patients probably
had metastatic disease at the time of entry on active surveillance. The 450
patients were followed for a median of 6.8 years; OS was 78.6% and
prostate cancer-specific survival was 97.2%.323 Of the 30% (n = 145) of
patients who progressed, 8% had an increase in Gleason grade, 14% had
a PSADT less than 3 years, 1% developed a prostate nodule, and 3%
were treated because of anxiety. One hundred thirty-five of these 145
patients were treated: 35 by radical prostatectomy, 90 by EBRT with or
without ADT, and 10 with ADT alone. Follow-up is available for 110 of
these patients, and 5-year biochemical PFS is 62% for those undergoing
radical prostatectomy and 43% for those undergoing radiation. Longerterm follow-up of this cohort was reported in 2015.231 The 10- and 15-year
actuarial cause-specific survival rates for the entire cohort were 98.1% and
94.3%, respectively. Only 15 of 993 (1.5%) patients had died of prostate
cancer, an additional 13 patients (1.3%) had developed metastatic
disease, and only 36.5% of the cohort had received treatment by 10 years.
In an analysis of 592 patients enrolled in this cohort who had 1 or more
repeat prostate biopsies, 31.3% of cases were upgraded. Fifteen percent
of upgraded cases were upgraded to Gleason ≥8, and 62% of total
upgraded cases proceeded to active treatment.328 Another analysis of this
cohort revealed that metastatic disease developed in 13 of 133 patients
with Gleason 7 disease (9.8%) and 17 of 847 patients with Gleason ≤6
disease (2.0%).329 PSADT and the number of positive scores were also
predictors of increased risk for the development of metastatic disease.

In comparison, among 192 patients on active surveillance who underwent
delayed treatment at a median of 2 years after diagnosis in the Johns
Hopkins experience, 5-year biochemical PFS was 96% for those who
underwent radical prostatectomy and 75% for those who underwent
radiation.325 The two groups were similar by pathologic Gleason grade,
pathologic stage, and margin positivity. All patients treated by radical
prostatectomy after progression on active surveillance had freedom from
biochemical progression at a median follow-up of 37.5 months, compared
to 97% of those in the primary radical prostatectomy group at a median
follow-up of 35.5 months. A later publication from this group showed that
23 of 287 patients who were treated after active surveillance (8%)
experienced biochemical recurrence, and the rate was independent of the
type of treatment.230 Several studies have shown that delayed radical
prostatectomy does not increase the rates of adverse pathology.237,330-332

Radical Prostatectomy
Radical prostatectomy is appropriate for any patient whose cancer
appears clinically localized to the prostate. However, because of potential
perioperative morbidity, radical prostatectomy should generally be
reserved for patients whose life expectancy is 10 years or more.
Stephenson and colleagues128 reported a low 15-year prostate cancerspecific mortality of 12% in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy
(5% for patients with low-risk disease), although it is unclear whether the
favorable prognosis is due to the effectiveness of the procedure or the low
lethality of cancers detected in the PSA era.
Radical prostatectomy was compared to watchful waiting in a randomized
trial of 695 patients with early-stage prostate cancer (mostly T2).333,334 With
a median follow-up of 12.8 years, those assigned to the radical
prostatectomy group had significant improvements in disease-specific
survival, OS, and risk of metastasis and local progression.333 The reduction
in mortality was confirmed at 18 years of follow-up, with an absolute

difference of 11%.334 Overall, 8 patients needed to be treated to avert one
death; that number fell to 4 for patients younger than 65 years of age.
Longer follow-up results were also reported, in which the cumulative
incidence of death from prostate cancer was 19.6% and 31.3% in the
radical prostatectomy and watchful waiting groups, respectively, at 23
years, with a mean increase of 2.9 years of life in the radical
prostatectomy group.335 The results of this trial offer high-quality evidence
to support radical prostatectomy as a treatment option for clinically
localized prostate cancer.
Some patients at high or very high risk may benefit from radical
prostatectomy. In an analysis of 842 patients with Gleason scores 8 to 10
at biopsy who underwent radical prostatectomy, predictors of unfavorable
outcome included PSA level over 10 ng/mL, clinical stage T2b or higher,
Gleason score 9 or 10, higher number of biopsy cores with high-grade
cancer, and over 50% core involvement.336 Patients without these
characteristics showed higher 10-year biochemical-free and diseasespecific survival after radical prostatectomy compared to those with
unfavorable findings (31% vs. 4% and 75% vs. 52%, respectively). Radical
prostatectomy is an option for patients with high-risk disease and in select
patients with very-high-risk disease.
Retrospective data and population-based studies suggest that radical
prostatectomy with PLND can be an effective option for patients with cN1
disease.337-339 Extrapolation of results of STAMPEDE arm H, in which
EBRT to the primary tumor improved OS and other endpoints in patients
with low-volume metastatic disease, also suggests that local treatment to
the prostate may be beneficial in patients with advanced disease.340
Radical prostatectomy is a treatment option for patients experiencing
biochemical recurrence after primary EBRT, but morbidity (incontinence,
erectile dysfunction, and bladder neck contracture) remains significantly
higher than when radical prostatectomy is used as initial therapy.341,342

Overall and cancer-specific 10-year survival ranged from 54% to 89% and
70% to 83%, respectively.341 Patient selection is important, and post-RT
recurrence radical prostatectomy should only be performed by highly
experienced surgeons.
Operative Techniques and Adverse Effects
Long-term cancer control has been achieved in most patients with both the
retropubic and the perineal approaches to radical prostatectomy; highvolume surgeons in high-volume centers generally achieve superior
outcomes.343,344 Laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy are
commonly used and are considered comparable to conventional
approaches in experienced hands.345-347 In a cohort study using SEER
Medicare-linked data on 8837 patients, minimally invasive compared to
open radical prostatectomy was associated with shorter length of hospital
stay, less need for blood transfusions, and fewer surgical complications,
but rates of incontinence and erectile dysfunction were higher.348 A second
large study reported no difference in overall complications, readmission,
and additional cancer therapies between open and robot-assisted radical
prostatectomy, although the robotic approach was associated with higher
rates of genitourinary complications and lower rates of blood
transfusion.349 Oncologic outcome of a robotic versus open approach was
similar when assessed by use of additional therapies348 or rate of positive
surgical margins,350 although longer follow-up is necessary. A metaanalysis on 19 observational studies (n = 3893) reported less blood loss
and lower transfusion rates with minimally invasive techniques than with
open operation.350 Risk of positive surgical margins was the same. Two
more recent meta-analyses showed a statistically significant advantage in
favor of a robotic approach compared to an open approach in 12-month
urinary continence351 and potency recovery.352 Early results from a
randomized controlled phase 3 study comparing robot-assisted
laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open radical retropubic
prostatectomy in 326 patients were published in 2016.353,354 Urinary

function and sexual function scores and rates of postoperative
complications did not differ significantly between the groups at 6, 12, and
24 months after surgery. Rates of positive surgical margins were similar,
based on a superiority test (10% in the open group vs. 15% in the robotic
group). Assessment of oncologic outcomes from this trial will be limited
because postoperative management and additional cancer therapies were
not standardized between the groups.353
An analysis of the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study on 1655 patients with
localized prostate cancer compared long-term functional outcomes after
radical prostatectomy or EBRT.355 At 2 and 5 years, patients who
underwent radical prostatectomy reported higher rates of urinary
incontinence and erectile dysfunction but lower rates of bowel urgency.
However, no significant difference was observed at 15 years. In a large
retrospective cohort study involving 32,465 patients, those who received
EBRT had a lower 5-year incidence of urologic procedures than those who
underwent radical prostatectomy, but higher incidence for hospital
admissions, rectal or anal procedures, open surgical procedures, and
secondary malignancies.356
Return of urinary continence after radical prostatectomy may be improved
by preserving the urethra beyond the prostatic apex and by avoiding
damage to the distal sphincter mechanism. Bladder neck preservation
may allow more rapid recovery of urinary control.357 Anastomotic strictures
that increase the risk of long-term incontinence are less frequent with
modern surgical techniques. Recovery of erectile function is related
directly to the degree of preservation of the cavernous nerves, age at
surgery, and preoperative erectile function. Improvement in urinary and
sexual function has been reported with nerve-sparing techniques.358,359
Replacement of resected nerves with nerve grafts does not appear to be
effective for patients undergoing wide resection of the neurovascular

bundles.360 The ability of mpMRI to detect extracapsular extension can aid
in decision-making in nerve-sparing surgery.178
Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection
The decision to perform PLND should be guided by the probability of nodal
metastases. The NCCN Guidelines Panel chose 2% as the cutoff for
PLND because this avoids 47.7% of PLNDs at a cost of missing 12.1% of
positive pelvic lymph nodes.133 A more recent analysis of 26,713 patients
in the SEER database treated with radical prostatectomy and PLND
between 2010 and 2013 found that the 2% nomogram threshold would
avoid 22.3% of PLNDs at a cost of missing 3.0% of positive pelvic lymph
nodes.361 The Panel recommends use of a nomogram developed at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center that uses pretreatment PSA,
clinical stage, and Gleason sum to predict the risk of pelvic lymph node
metastases.133
PLND should be performed using an extended technique.362,363 An
extended PLND includes removal of all node-bearing tissue from an area
bounded by the external iliac vein anteriorly, the pelvic side wall laterally,
the bladder wall medially, the floor of the pelvis posteriorly, Cooper’s
ligament distally, and the internal iliac artery proximally. Removal of more
lymph nodes using the extended technique has been associated with
increased likelihood of finding lymph node metastases, thereby providing
more complete staging.364-366 A survival advantage with more extensive
lymphadenectomy has been suggested by several studies, possibly due to
elimination of microscopic metastases,365,367-369 although definitive proof of
oncologic benefit is lacking.370 PLND can be performed safely
laparoscopically, robotically, or as an open procedure, and complication
rates should be similar among the three approaches.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
Radiation Therapy
RT techniques used in prostate cancer include EBRT, proton radiation,
and brachytherapy. EBRT techniques include IMRT and hypofractionated,
image-guided SBRT. An analysis that included propensity-score matching
of patients showed that, among younger patients with prostate cancer,
stereotactic body RT (SBRT) and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) had
similar toxicity profiles whereas proton radiation was associated with
reduced urinary toxicity and increased bowel toxicity. The cost of proton
therapy was almost double that of IMRT, and SBRT was slightly less
expensive.371
The panel believes that highly conformal RT (CRT) techniques should be
used to treat localized prostate cancer. Photon and proton beam radiation
are both effective at achieving highly CRT with acceptable and similar
biochemical control and long-term side effect profiles. Radiation
techniques are discussed in more detail below.
External Beam Radiation Therapy
Over the past several decades, EBRT techniques have evolved to allow
higher doses of radiation to be administered safely. Three-dimensional
(3D) CRT (3D-CRT) uses computer software to integrate CT images of the
patients’ internal anatomy in the treatment position, which allows higher
cumulative doses to be delivered with lower risk of late effects.144,372-374 The
second-generation 3D technique, IMRT, has been used increasingly in
practice.375 IMRT reduced the risk of gastrointestinal toxicities and rates of
post-recurrence therapy compared to 3D-CRT in some but not all older
retrospective and population-based studies, although treatment cost is
increased.376-379
More recently, moderately hypofractionated image-guided IMRT regimens
(2.4–4 Gy per fraction over 4–6 weeks) have been tested in randomized
trials, and their efficacy has been similar or non-inferior to conventionally

fractionated IMRT, with one trial showing fewer treatment failures with a
moderately fractionated regimen.380-389 Toxicity was similar between
moderately hypofractionated and conventional regimens in some380,384,387,388
but not all of the trials.382,385,386 In addition, efficacy results varied among the
trials, with some showing noninferiority or similar efficacy and others
showing that hypofractionation may be less effective than conventional
fractionation schemes. These safety and efficacy differences are likely a
result of differences in fractionation schedules.390 In addition, results of a
large cohort study showed no differences in QOL or urinary or bowel
function between those that received hypofractionated versus
conventional regimens.391 Overall, the panel believes that hypofractionated
IMRT techniques, which are more convenient for patients, can be
considered as an alternative to conventionally fractionated regimens when
clinically indicated. The panel lists fractionation schemes that have shown
acceptable efficacy and toxicity on PROS-F page 3 of 5 in the algorithm
above. An ASTRO/ASCO/AUA evidence-based guideline regarding the
use of hypofractionated radiation in patients with localized prostate cancer
concluded that moderately fractionated regimens are justified for routine
use in this setting and provides more detail on the topic.392
Daily prostate localization using image-guided RT (IGRT) is essential with
either 3D-CRT or IMRT for target margin reduction and treatment
accuracy. Imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, implanted fiducials,
electromagnetic targeting and tracking, or endorectal balloon, can improve
cure rates and decrease complications.
These techniques have permitted safer dose escalation, and results of
randomized trials have suggested that dose escalation is associated with
improved biochemical outcomes.393-398 Kuban and colleagues396 published
an analysis of their dose-escalation trial of 301 patients with stage T1b to
T3 prostate cancer. Freedom from biochemical or clinical recurrence was
higher in the group randomized to 78 Gy compared to 70 Gy (78% vs.

Prostate Cancer
59%, P = .004) at a median follow-up of 8.7 years. The difference was
even greater among patients with diagnostic PSA >10 ng/mL (78% vs.
39%, P = .001). A longer follow-up (mean 14.3 years) found that
improvements in biochemical and clinical recurrences were sustained, with
lower rates of additional cancer treatment and better prostate cancerspecific mortality.399 OS was not improved.
An analysis of the National Cancer Database found that dose escalation
(75.6–90 Gy) resulted in a dose-dependent improvement in OS for
patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer.400 In light of these
findings, the conventional 70 Gy dose is no longer considered adequate. A
dose of 75.6 to 79.2 Gy in conventional fractions to the prostate (with or
without seminal vesicles) is appropriate for patients with low-risk cancers.
Patients Intermediate-risk and high-risk disease should receive doses of
up to 81.0 Gy.376,401,402
Data suggested that EBRT and radical prostatectomy were effective for
the treatment of localized prostate cancer.403 EBRT of the primary prostate
cancer shows several distinct advantages over radical prostatectomy.
EBRT avoids complications associated with operation, such as bleeding
and transfusion-related effects, and risks associated with anesthesia, such
as myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolus. 3D-CRT and IMRT
techniques are widely available and are possible for patients over a wide
range of ages. EBRT has a low risk of urinary incontinence and stricture
and a good chance of short-term preservation of erectile function.404
The disadvantages of EBRT include a treatment course of 8 to 9 weeks.
Up to 50% of patients have some temporary bladder or bowel symptoms
during treatment. There is a low but definite risk of protracted rectal
symptoms from radiation proctitis, and the risk of erectile dysfunction
increases over time.404,405 The risk of late rectal complications following RT
is related to the volume of the rectum receiving doses of radiation close to
or exceeding the radiation dose required to control the primary tumor.

Biomaterials have been developed, tested, and FDA approved to serve as
spacer materials when inserted between the rectum and prostate.406,407 In a
randomized phase 3 multicenter clinical trial of patients undergoing imageguided IMRT (IG-IMRT), where the risk of late (3-year) common
terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) was grade 2 or higher,
physician-recorded rectal complications declined from 5.7% to 0% in the
control versus hydrogel spacer group.408 The hydrogel spacer group had a
significant reduction in bowel QOL decline. No significant differences in
adverse events were noted in those receiving hydrogel placement versus
controls. Results of a secondary analysis of this trial suggest that use of a
perirectal spacer may decrease the sexual side effects of radiation.409
Spacer implantation, however, is quite expensive and may be associated
with rare complications such as rectum perforation and urethral
damage.410,411 Retrospective data also support its use in similar patients
undergoing brachytherapy. Overall, the panel believes that biocompatible
and biodegradable perirectal spacer materials may be implanted between
the prostate and rectum in patients undergoing external radiotherapy with
organ-confined prostate cancer in order to displace the rectum from high
radiation dose regions. Patients with obvious rectal invasion or visible T3
and posterior extension should not undergo perirectal spacer implantation.
If the cancer recurs, radical prostatectomy after RT is associated with a
higher risk of complications than primary radical prostatectomy.412
Contraindications to EBRT include prior pelvic irradiation, active
inflammatory disease of the rectum, or a permanent indwelling Foley
catheter. Relative contraindications include very low bladder capacity,
chronic moderate or severe diarrhea, bladder outlet obstruction requiring a
suprapubic catheter, and inactive ulcerative colitis.
EBRT for Early Disease

EBRT is one of the principal treatment options for clinically localized
prostate cancer. The NCCN Guidelines Panel consensus was that modern

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
EBRT and surgical series show similar PFS in patients with low-risk
disease treated with radical prostatectomy or EBRT. In a study of 3546
patients treated with brachytherapy plus EBRT, disease-free survival
(DFS) remained steady at 73% between 15 and 25 years of follow-up.413
The panel lists several acceptable dosing schemas in the guidelines. The
NRG Oncology/RTOG 0126 randomized clinical trial compared 79.2 Gy
(44 fractions) and 70.2 Gy (39 fractions), both in 1.8 Gy fractions, in 1499
patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.414 After a median follow-up
of 8.4 years, the escalated dose reduced biochemical recurrences, but
increased late toxicity and had no effect on OS.
EBRT for Patients with High-Risk or Very-High-Risk Disease

EBRT has demonstrated efficacy in patients with high-risk and very-highrisk prostate cancer. One study randomized 415 patients to EBRT alone or
EBRT plus 3-year ADT.415 In another study (RTOG 8531), 977 patients
with T3 disease treated with EBRT were randomized to adjuvant ADT or
ADT at relapse.416 Two other randomized phase 3 trials evaluated longterm ADT with or without radiation in a population of patients who mostly
had T3 disease.417-420 In all four studies, the combination group showed
improved disease-specific survival and OS compared to single-modality
treatment. Patients with a PSA nadir >0.5 ng/mL after radiation and 6
months of ADT have an adjusted HR for all-cause mortality of 1.72 (95%
CI, 1.17–2.52; P = .01) compared with patients who received radiation
only.421
Prophylactic nodal radiation should be considered in this population. 422-424
The randomized controlled phase 3 POP-RT trial showed that pelvic
radiation can improve biochemical failure-free survival (FFS) and DFS
compared with prostate-only radiation in patients with high- and very-highrisk prostate cancer.425 The randomized phase 3 FLAME trial showed that
a focal radiation boost to the mpMRI-visible lesion can improve
biochemical DFS in this population.426

Some earlier data suggested that the use of docetaxel in combination with
ADT and EBRT may benefit fit patients with high- and very-high-risk
localized disease. The GETUG 12 trial randomized 413 patients with highor very-high-risk prostate cancer to IMRT and ADT or ADT, docetaxel, and
estramustine.427 After a median follow-up of 8.8 years, 8-year relapse-free
survival was 62% in the combination therapy arm and 50% in the ADTonly arm (adjusted HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54–0.94; P = .017). The
multicenter, phase 3 NRG Oncology RTOG 0521 trial randomized 563
patients with high- or very-high-risk prostate cancer ADT plus EBRT with
or without docetaxel.428 After a median follow-up of 5.7 years, 4-year OS
was 89% (95% CI, 84%–92%) for ADT/EBRT and 93% (95% CI, 90%–
96%) for ADT/EBRT/docetaxel (HR, 0.69; 90% CI, 0.49–0.97; one-sided P
= .03). Improvements were also seen in DFS and the rate of distant
metastasis. In the STAMPEDE trial, the addition of docetaxel to EBRT and
ADT improved FFS in the non-metastatic group (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45–
0.80; P < .01).429 OS analysis did not show a significant difference, but was
limited in power. Based on these data, the panel recommends the addition
of docetaxel added to EBRT and 2 years of ADT as an option for patients
with very-high-risk prostate cancer. The Panel recommends the addition of
docetaxel to ADT plus EBRT as an option for patients with very-high-risk
prostate cancer, but does not recommend it for patients with high-risk
prostate cancer at this time.
The Panel recommends the addition of abiraterone to ADT plus EBRT as
an option for patients with very-high-risk prostate cancer (fine-particle
abiraterone can also be used, category 2B). This recommendation is
based on data from the STAMPEDE trial. In STAMPEDE, the HRs for FFS
in patients with non-metastatic disease treated with EBRT/ADT plus
abiraterone compared with EBRT/ADT was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.15–0.31).430

Prostate Cancer
A head-to-head comparison of ADT with either abiraterone or docetaxel in
this setting and in patients with metastatic disease showed no difference in
safety or in efficacy endpoints including OS.431
EBRT for Node-Positive Disease

EBRT with neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant ADT is the preferred
option for patients with clinical N1 disease. Abiraterone can be added. In
addition, ADT alone or with abiraterone are options. In each case, the use
of the fine-particle formulation of abiraterone is a category 2B
recommendation.
For adjuvant therapy for node-positive disease after radical prostatectomy,
see Adjuvant Therapy for pN1, below.
EBRT to the Primary Tumor in Low-Volume M1 Disease

Patients with newly diagnosed, low-volume metastatic prostate cancer can
be considered for ADT with EBRT to the primary tumor based on results
from the randomized controlled phase 3 STAMPEDE trial.340 In this
multicenter, international study, 2061 patients were randomized to lifelong
ADT with or without EBRT to the primary tumor (either 55 Gy in 20 daily
fractions over 4 weeks or 36 Gy in 6 weekly fractions over 6 weeks). The
primary outcome of OS by intention-to-treat analysis was not met (HR,
0.92; 95% CI, 0.80–1.06; P = .266), but EBRT improved the secondary
outcome of FFS (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68–0.84; P < .0001). In a preplanned subset analysis, outcomes of patients with high metastatic burden
(defined as visceral metastases; ≥4 bone metastases with ≥1 outside the
vertebral bodies or pelvis; or both) and those with low metastatic burden
(all others) were determined. EBRT improved OS (adjusted HR, 0.68; 95%
CI, 0.52–0.90), prostate cancer-specific survival (adjusted HR, 0.65; 95%
CI, 0.47–0.90), FFS (adjusted HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49–0.72), and PFS
(adjusted HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63–0.98) in patients with low metastatic
burden, but not in patients with high metastatic burden. Randomized
clinical trials are ongoing to better test the value of removal or radiation of

the primary tumor in patients with low metastatic burden who are
beginning ADT.432-436
The Panel recommends against EBRT to the primary tumor in the case of
high-volume M1 disease based on the HORRAD and STAMPEDE
trials.340,437 No improvement in OS was seen from the addition of EBRT to
the primary when combined with standard systemic therapy in patients
with high-volume M1 disease in either trial.
Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
The relatively slow proliferation rate of prostate cancer is reflected in a low
α/β ratio,438 most commonly reported between 1 and 4. These values are
similar to that for the rectal mucosa. Because the α/β ratio for prostate
cancer is similar to or lower than the surrounding tissues responsible for
most of the toxicity reported with radiation, appropriately designed
radiation treatment fields and schedules using extremely hypofractionated
regimens should result in similar cancer control rates without increased
risk of late toxicity.
SBRT is a technique that delivers highly conformal, high-dose radiation in
five or fewer treatment fractions, which are safe to administer only with
precise, image-guided delivery.439 Single-institution series with median
follow-up as long as 6 years report excellent biochemical PFS and similar
early toxicity (bladder, rectal, and QOL) compared to standard radiation
techniques.438-444 According to a pooled analysis of phase 2 trials, the 5year biochemical relapse-free survival is 95%, 84%, and 81% for patients
with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease, respectively.445 A study of
individual patient data from a cohort of 2142 patients with low- or
intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 10 single-institution phase 2 trials
and 2 multi-institutional phase 2 trials found that the 7-year cumulative
rates of biochemical recurrence were 4.5%, 8.6%, and 14.9% for low-risk
disease, favorable intermediate-risk disease, and unfavorable

Prostate Cancer
intermediate-risk disease, respectively.446 Severe acute toxicity was rare,
at 0.6% for grade 3 or higher genitourinary toxic events and 0.09% for
grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal toxic events. Late (7-year cumulative
incidence) toxicity rates were 2.4% and 0.4% for grade 3 or higher
genitourinary toxic events and gastrointestinal toxic events, respectively.

because earlier studies found it less effective than EBRT for high-risk
disease.101,454 However, increasing evidence suggests that technical
advancements in brachytherapy may provide a role for contemporary
brachytherapy in high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate
cancer.455,456

SBRT may be associated with more toxicity than moderately fractionated
IMRT. One retrospective study of 4005 patients reported higher
genitourinary toxicity at 24 months after SBRT than IMRT (44% vs. 36%; P
= .001).447 Another phase 2 trial found increased toxicity with doses >47.5
Gy delivered in 5 fractions.448 An analysis using the SEER database also
reported that SBRT was more toxic than IMRT.449 Overall, prospective
evidence supports the use of SBRT in the setting of localized prostate
cancer.450

The advantage of brachytherapy is that the treatment is completed in 1
day with little time lost from normal activities. In appropriate patients, the
cancer-control rates appear comparable to radical prostatectomy (over
90%) for low-risk prostate cancer with medium-term follow-up.457 In
addition, the risk of incontinence is minimal in patients without a previous
transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and erectile function is
preserved in the short term.405 Disadvantages of brachytherapy include the
requirement for general anesthesia and the risk of acute urinary retention.
Irritative voiding symptoms may persist for as long as 1 year after
implantation. The risk of incontinence is greater after TURP because of
acute retention and bladder neck contractures, and many patients develop
progressive erectile dysfunction over several years. IMRT causes less
acute and late genitourinary toxicity and similar freedom from biochemical
recurrence compared with iodine-125 or palladium-103 permanent seed
implants.458,459 Current brachytherapy techniques attempt to improve the
radioactive seed placement and radiation dose distribution.

Several phase 3 trials have been initiated comparing conventional
regimens to SBRT.451-453 Preliminary results show that the genitourinary
and bowel toxicity is similar with the two techniques. In addition, the
HYPO-RT-PC trial demonstrated non-inferiority of 42.7 Gy in seven
fractions to 78.0 Gy in 39 fractions with respect to FFS in patients with
intermediate-to-high-risk prostate cancer.453
SBRT/extremely hypofractionated IG-IMRT regimens (6.5 Gy per fraction
or greater) can be considered as an alternative to conventionally
fractionated regimens at clinics with appropriate technology, physics, and
clinical expertise. Longer follow-up and prospective multi-institutional data
are required to evaluate longer-term results, especially because late
toxicity theoretically could be worse in hypofractionated regimens
compared to conventional fractionation (1.8–2.0 Gy per fraction).
Brachytherapy
Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive sources into the prostate
tissue. Brachytherapy has been used traditionally for low-risk cases

There are currently two methods for prostate brachytherapy: low dose-rate
(LDR) and high dose-rate (HDR). LDR brachytherapy consists of
placement of permanent seed implants in the prostate. The short range of
the radiation emitted from these low-energy sources allows delivery of
adequate dose levels to the cancer within the prostate, with excessive
irradiation of the bladder and rectum avoided. Post-implant dosimetry
should be performed to document the quality of an LDR implant.460 HDR
brachytherapy, which involves temporary insertion of a radiation source, is
a newer approach.

Two groups have observed a lower risk of urinary frequency, urgency, and

brachytherapy are listed in the guidelines.
For patients with very large or very small prostates, symptoms of bladder
outlet obstruction (high International Prostate Symptom Score), or a
previous TURP, seed implantation may be more difficult. These patients
also have an increased risk of side effects. Neoadjuvant ADT may be used
to shrink the prostate to an acceptable size; however, increased toxicity is
expected from ADT, and prostate size may not decline in some patients.
The potential toxicity of ADT must be weighed against the possible benefit
of target reduction.
Ideally, the accuracy of brachytherapy treatment should be verified by
daily prostate localization with techniques of IGRT: CT, ultrasound,
implanted fiducials, or electromagnetic targeting/tracking. Endorectal
balloons may be used to improve prostate immobilization. Perirectal
spacer materials (discussed under External Beam Radiation Therapy,
above) may be employed when the previously mentioned techniques are
insufficient to improve oncologic cure rates and/or reduce side effects due
to anatomic geometry or other patient-related factors (eg, medication
usage, comorbid conditions). Patients with obvious rectal invasion or
visible T3 and posterior extension should not undergo perirectal spacer
implantation.

for brachytherapy alone. Either LDR or HDR brachytherapy can be used in
this setting.
Retrospective analyses show that LDR or HDR brachytherapy alone can
be effective and well tolerated in this population.464-468 A phase 2 trial in
300 patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer also found LDR
brachytherapy alone to be safe and effective.469 However, randomized
controlled trials comparing brachytherapy to radical prostatectomy or
EBRT in this population are limited. In a single-center trial, 165 patients
with low-risk prostate cancer were randomized to LDR brachytherapy with
iodine-125 seeds or radical prostatectomy. The 2-year biochemical FFS
rates were similar between the groups at 96.1% after brachytherapy and
97.4% after radical prostatectomy (P = .35).470 At 6-month follow-up,
continence was better in the brachytherapy group whereas potency was
better in the radical prostatectomy group.
Brachytherapy Boost

LDR or HDR brachytherapy can be added as a boost to EBRT plus ADT in
patients with unfavorable intermediate-, high-, or very-high-risk prostate
cancer being treated with curative intent. Combining EBRT and
brachytherapy allows dose escalation while minimizing acute or late
toxicity in patients with high-risk localized or locally advanced cancer.471-474
This combination has demonstrated improved biochemical control over
EBRT plus ADT alone in randomized trials, but with higher toxicity.475-477 An
analysis of a cohort of 12,745 patients with high-risk disease found that
treatment with brachytherapy (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49–0.86) or
brachytherapy plus EBRT (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66–0.90) lowered diseasespecific mortality compared to EBRT alone.478

Brachytherapy Alone for Localized Disease

Brachytherapy alone is an option for patients with very low, low, or
favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, depending on life expectancy.
Patients with high-risk cancers are generally considered poor candidates

The randomized ASCENDE-RT trial compared two methods of dose
escalation in 398 patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer:
dose-escalated EBRT boost to 78 Gy or LDR brachytherapy boost.479 All
patients were initially treated with 12 months of ADT and pelvic EBRT to

46 Gy. An intention-to-treat analysis found that the primary endpoint of
biochemical PFS was 89% versus 84% at 5 years; 86% versus 75% at 7
years; and 83% versus 62% at 9 years for the LDR versus EBRT boost
arms (log-rank P < .001). Toxicity was higher in the brachytherapy arm,
with the cumulative incidence of grade 3 genitourinary events at 5 years of
18.4% for brachytherapy boost and 5.2% for EBRT boost (P < .001).480 A
trend for increased gastrointestinal toxicity with brachytherapy boost was
also seen (cumulative incidence of grade 3 events at 5 years, 8.1% vs.
3.2%; P = .12). However, at 6-year follow-up, health-related QOL was
similar between the groups in most domains, except that physical and
urinary function scales were significantly lower in the LDR arm.481 Whereas
the toxicity is increased with the use of brachytherapy boost, this and other
randomized controlled trials have failed to show an improvement in OS or
cancer-specific survival.482
Addition of ADT (2 or 3 years) to brachytherapy and EBRT is common for
patients at high risk of recurrence. The outcome of trimodality treatment is
excellent, with 9-year PFS and disease-specific survival reaching 87% and
91%, respectively.483,484 However, it remains unclear whether the ADT
component contributes to outcome improvement. D’Amico and colleagues
studied a cohort of 1342 patients with PSA over 20 ng/mL and clinical
T3/T4 and/or Gleason score 8 to 10 disease.485 Addition of either EBRT or
ADT to brachytherapy did not confer an advantage over brachytherapy
alone. The use of all three modalities reduced prostate cancer-specific
mortality compared to brachytherapy alone (adjusted HR, 0.32; 95% CI,
0.14–0.73). Other analyses did not find an improvement in recurrence rate
when ADT was added to brachytherapy and EBRT.486,487
A large, multicenter, retrospective cohort analysis that included 1809
patients with Gleason score 9–10 prostate cancer found that multimodality
therapy with EBRT, brachytherapy, and ADT was associated with
improved prostate cancer-specific mortality and longer time to distant

metastasis than either radical prostatectomy or EBRT with ADT.488 In
addition, an analysis of outcomes of almost 43,000 patients with high-risk
prostate cancer in the National Cancer Database found that mortality was
similar in patients treated with EBRT, brachytherapy, and ADT versus
those treated with radical prostatectomy, but was worse in those treated
with EBRT and ADT.489
To address historical trial data concerns for increased toxicity incidence
associated with brachytherapy boost, careful patient selection and
contemporary planning associated with lesser toxicity, such as use of
recognized organ at risk dose constraints, use of high-quality ultrasound
and other imaging, and prescription of dose as close as possible to the
target without excessive margins should be implemented.
Post-Recurrence Brachytherapy

Brachytherapy can be considered in patients with biochemical recurrence
after EBRT. In a retrospective study of 24 patients who had EBRT as
primary therapy and permanent brachytherapy after biochemical
recurrence, the cancer-free and biochemical relapse-free survival rates
were 96% and 88%, respectively, after a median follow-up of 30 months.490
Results of a phase 2 study of post-recurrence HDR brachytherapy after
EBRT included relapse-free survival, distant metastases-free survival, and
cause-specific survival rates of 68.5%, 81.5%, and 90.3%, respectively, at
5 years.491 Toxicities were mostly grade 1 and 2 and included
gastrointestinal toxicity and urethral strictures, and one case of Grade 3
urinary incontinence. In another prospective phase 2 trial, the primary
endpoint of grade ≥3 late treatment-related gastrointestinal and
genitourinary adverse events at 9 to 24 months after post-recurrence
brachytherapy was below the unacceptable threshold, at 14%.492
Data on the use of brachytherapy after permanent brachytherapy are
limited, but the panel agrees that it can be considered for carefully
selected patients. Decisions regarding the use of brachytherapy in the

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
recurrent-disease setting should consider comorbidities, extent of disease,
and potential complications. Brachytherapy in this setting is best
performed at high-volume centers.
Proton Therapy
Proton beam RT has been used to treat patients with cancer since the
1950s. Proponents of proton therapy argue that this form of RT could have
advantages over x-ray (photon)-based radiation in certain clinical
circumstances. Proton therapy and x-ray–based therapies like IMRT can
deliver highly conformal doses to the prostate. Proton-based therapies will
deliver less radiation dose to some of the surrounding normal tissues like
muscle, bone, vessels, and fat not immediately adjacent to the prostate.
These tissues do not routinely contribute to the morbidity of prostate
radiation and are relatively resilient to radiation injury; therefore, the
benefit of decreased dose to these types of normal, non-critical tissues
has not been apparent. The critical normal structures adjacent to the
prostate that can create prostate cancer treatment morbidity include the
bladder, rectum, neurovascular bundles, and occasionally small bowel.
The weight of the current evidence about prostate cancer treatment
morbidity supports the notion that the volume of the rectum and bladder
that receives radiobiologically high doses of radiation near the prescription
radiation dose accounts for the likelihood of long-term treatment morbidity,
as opposed to higher volume, lower dose exposures. Numerous
dosimetric studies have been performed trying to compare x-ray–based
IMRT plans to proton therapy plans to illustrate how one or the other type
of treatment can be used to spare the bladder or rectum from higher dose
parts of the exposure. These studies suffer from the biases and talents of
the investigators who plan and create computer models of dose deposition
for one therapy or the other.493 Although dosimetric studies in-silico can
suggest that the right treatment planning can make an IMRT plan beat a

proton therapy plan and vice versa, they do not accurately predict clinically
meaningful endpoints.
Comparative effectiveness studies have been published in an attempt to
compare toxicity and oncologic outcomes between proton and photon
therapies. Two comparisons between patients treated with proton therapy
or EBRT report similar early toxicity rates.494,495 A prospective QOL
comparison of patient-reported outcomes using the EPIC instrument
between IMRT (204 patients) and proton therapy (1234 patients)
concluded that “No differences were observed in summary score changes
for bowel, urinary incontinence, urinary irritative/obstructive, and sexual
domains between the 2 cohorts” after up to 2 years of follow-up.496 A
Medicare analysis of 421 patients treated with proton therapy and a
matched cohort of 842 patients treated with IMRT showed less
genitourinary toxicity at 6 months for protons, although the difference
disappeared after 1 year.495 No other significant differences were seen
between the groups. In contrast, a single-center report of prospectively
collected QOL data revealed significant problems with incontinence, bowel
dysfunction, and impotence at 3 months, 12 months, and greater than 2
years after treatment with proton therapy.494 In that report, only 28% of
patients with normal erectile function maintained it after therapy. The
largest retrospective comparative effectiveness analysis to date comparing
IMRT to proton therapy was performed using SEER-Medicare claims data
for the following long-term endpoints: gastrointestinal morbidity, urinary
incontinence, non-incontinence urinary morbidity, sexual dysfunction, and
hip fractures.497 With follow-up as mature as 80 months and using both
propensity scoring and instrumental variable analysis, the authors
concluded that patients receiving IMRT therapy had statistically
significantly lower gastrointestinal morbidity than patients receiving proton
therapy, whereas rates of urinary incontinence, non-incontinence urinary
morbidity, sexual dysfunction, hip fractures, and additional cancer
therapies were statistically indistinguishable between the cohorts.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
However, firm conclusions regarding differences in toxicity or effectiveness
of proton and photon therapy cannot be drawn because of the limitations
inherent in retrospective/observational studies.
The costs associated with proton beam facility construction and proton
beam treatment are high compared to the expense of building and using
the more common photon linear accelerator-based practice.495 The
American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) evaluated proton
therapy and created a model policy to support the society’s position on
payment coverage for proton beam therapy in 2014.498 This model policy
was updated in 2017 and recommends coverage of proton therapy for the
treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer if the patient is enrolled in
either an institutional review board (IRB)-approved study or a multiinstitutional registry that adheres to Medicare requirements for Coverage
with Evidence Development (CED). The policy states: “In the treatment of
prostate cancer, the use of [proton beam therapy] is evolving as the
comparative efficacy evidence is still being developed. In order for an
informed consensus on the role of [proton beam therapy] for prostate
cancer to be reached, it is essential to collect further data, especially to
understand how the effectiveness of proton therapy compares to other RT
modalities such as IMRT and brachytherapy. There is a need for more
well-designed registries and studies with sizable comparator cohorts to
help accelerate data collection. Proton beam therapy for primary treatment
of prostate cancer should only be performed within the context of a
prospective clinical trial or registry.”
A prospective phase 2 clinical trial enrolled 184 patients with low- or
intermediate-risk prostate cancer who received 70 Gy of hypofractionated
proton therapy in 28 fractions.499 The 4-year rate of biochemical-clinical
FFS was 93.5% (95% CI, 89%–98%). Grade ≥2 acute GI and urologic
toxicity rates were 3.8% and 12.5%, respectively. Late GI and urologic
toxicity rates were 7.6% and 13.6%, respectively, at 4 years.

The NCCN Panel believes no clear evidence supports a benefit or
decrement to proton therapy over IMRT for either treatment efficacy or
long-term toxicity. Conventionally fractionated prostate proton therapy can
be considered a reasonable alternative to x-ray–based regimens at clinics
with appropriate technology, physics, and clinical expertise.
Radiation for Distant Metastases
EBRT is an effective means of palliating isolated bone metastases from
prostate cancer. Studies have confirmed the common practice in Canada
and Europe of managing prostate cancer with bone metastases with a
short course of radiation to the bone. A short course of 8 Gy x 1 is as
effective as, and less costly than, 30 Gy in 10 fractions.500 In a randomized
trial of 898 patients with bone metastases, grade 2–4 acute toxicity was
observed less often in the 8-Gy arm (10%) than in the 30-Gy arm (17%) (P
= .002); however, the retreatment rate was higher in the 8-Gy group (18%)
than in the 30-Gy group (9%) (P < .001).501 In another study of 425
patients with painful bone metastases, a single dose of 8 Gy was noninferior to 20 Gy in multiple fractions in terms of overall pain response to
treatment.502 The SCORAD randomized trial failed to show non-inferiority
for ambulatory status of single-fraction 8-Gy EBRT to 20 Gy in 5
fractions.503
The Panel notes that 8 Gy as a single dose is as effective for pain
palliation at any bony site as longer courses of radiation, but re-treatment
rates are higher. Other regimens (ie, 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 37.5 Gy in 15
fractions) may be used as alternative palliative dosing depending on
clinical scenario (both category 2B).
Radiation to metastases has also been studied in the oligometastatic
setting. The ORIOLE phase 2 randomized trial randomized 54 patients
with recurrent castration-naïve prostate cancer and 1 to 3 metastases to
receive SABR or observation at a 2:1 ratio.504 The primary outcome

measure was progression at 6 months by increasing PSA, progression
detected by conventional imaging, symptomatic progression, initiation of
ADT for any reason, or death. Progression at 6 months was lower in
patients in the SABR arm than in the observation arm (19% vs. 61%; P =
.005). The secondary endpoint of PFS was also improved in the patients
who received SABR (not reached vs. 5.8 months; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11–
0.81; P = .002). The SABR-COMET phase 2, international trial
randomized 99 patients with controlled primary tumors and 1 to 5
metastatic lesions at 10 centers to standard of care or standard of care
plus SABR.505 Sixteen patients had prostate cancer. After a median followup of 51 months, the 5-year OS rate was higher in the SABR group
(17.7% vs. 42.3%; stratified log-rank P = .006), as was the 5-year PFS
rate (3.2% vs. 17.3%; P = .001). No differences were seen in adverse
events or QOL.
The Panel believes that SBRT to metastases can be considered in the
following circumstances:
• In patients with limited metastatic disease to the vertebra or
paravertebral region when ablation is the goal (eg, concern for
impending fracture or tumor encroachment on spinal nerves or
vertebra).
• In patients with oligometastatic progression where PFS is the goal.
• In symptomatic patients where the lesion occurs in or immediately
adjacent to a previously irradiated treatment field.
Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan

Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (Lu-177-PSMA-617) is a
radiopharmaceutical that is administered intravenously and is indicated for
PSMA-positive M1 CRPC that has been treated with androgen receptor
pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy.506 The active moiety
is a radionuclide which delivers radiation to PSMA-expressing and
surrounding cells, inducing DNA damage which leads to cell death.506 The

approval of Lu-177-PSMA-617 was based on the international, open-label
phase III VISION trial of 831 patients with M1 CRPC and PSMA-positive
metastatic lesions. Patients were previously treated with at least one
androgen receptor-directed therapy and one or two taxane-based
chemotherapy regimens. Patients had at least one PSMA-positive
metastatic lesion and no PSMA-negative lesions determined by gallium-68
(Ga-68) labeled PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging. Patients were randomized in
a 2:1 ratio to receive standard of care (abiraterone, enzalutamide,
bisphosphonates, radiation therapy, denosumab, and/or glucocorticoids)
and Lu-177-PSMA-617 (7.4 GBq or 200 mCi every 6 weeks for 4-6 cycles)
or standard of care alone. 507
The median OS was improved in the Lu-177-PSMA-617 group compared
to the control group (15.3 months vs. 11.3 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI,
0.52–0.74; P < .001). Similarly, the median PFS was improved in the Lu177-PSMA-617 group compared to the control group (8.7 months vs. 3.4
months; HR, 0.40; 99.2% CI, 0.29–0.57; P < .001). The incidence of grade
≥3 adverse events (particularly anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia,
and fatigue) was significantly higher in the Lu-177-PSMA-617 group
compared to the control group. 507
The NCCN Panel recommends Lu-177-PSMA-617 as a category 1, useful
in certain circumstances treatment option for patients with ≥1 PSMApositive lesion and/or metastatic disease that is predominately PSMApositive and with no dominant PSMA-negative metastatic lesions who
have been treated previously with androgen receptor-directed therapy and
a taxane-based chemotherapy. PSMA-negative lesions are defined as
metastatic disease that lacks PSMA uptake including bone with soft tissue
components ≥1.0 cm, lymph nodes ≥2.5 cm in short axis, and solid organ
metastases ≥1.0 cm in size. The NCCN Panel believes that both Ga-68
PSMA-11 or F-18 piflufolastat PSMA imaging can be used to determine
eligibility.

Prostate Cancer
Radium-223 and Other Radiopharmaceuticals

In May 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
radium-223 dichloride, an alpha particle-emitting radioactive agent. This
first-in-class radiopharmaceutical was approved for treatment of metastatic
CRPC in patients with symptomatic bone metastases and no known
visceral metastatic disease. Approval was based on clinical data from a
multicenter, phase 3, randomized trial (ALSYMPCA) that included 921
patients with symptomatic CRPC, two or more bone metastases, and no
known visceral disease.508 Fifty-seven percent of the patients received
prior docetaxel and all patients received best supportive care. Patients
were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 6 monthly radium-223 intravenous
injections or placebo. Compared to placebo, radium-223 significantly
improved OS (median 14.9 months vs. 11.3 months; HR, 0.70; 95% CI,
0.058–0.83; P < .001) and prolonged time to first skeletal-related event
(SRE) (median 15.6 months vs. 9.8 months). Preplanned subset analyses
showed that the survival benefit of radium-223 was maintained regardless
of prior docetaxel use.509 Intention-to-treat analyses from ALSYMPCA
showed that radium-223 also may reduce the risk of symptomatic SREs.510
Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity was low (3% neutropenia, 6%
thrombocytopenia, and 13% anemia), likely due to the short range of
radioactivity.508 Fecal elimination of the agent led to generally mild nonhematologic side effects, which included nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.
Radium-223 was associated with improved or slower decline of QOL in
ALSYMPCA.511
The multicenter, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3
ERA 223 trial randomized bone-metastatic patients with chemotherapynaïve CRPC to abiraterone with or without radium-223.512 The patients
were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The primary endpoint of
symptomatic skeletal event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population
was not met. In fact, the addition of radium-223 to abiraterone was

associated with an increased frequency of bone fractures compared with
placebo. The Panel therefore does not recommend this combination.
Radium-223 is a category 1 option to treat symptomatic bone metastases
without visceral metastases. Hematologic evaluation should be performed
according to the FDA label before treatment initiation and before each
subsequent dose.513 Radium-223 given in combination with chemotherapy
(such as docetaxel) outside of a clinical trial has the potential for additive
myelosuppression.513 It is not recommended for use in combination with
docetaxel or any other systemic therapy except ADT. It should not be used
in patients with visceral metastases, and it should be given with
concomitant denosumab or zoledronic acid.
Beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals are an effective and appropriate
option for patients with widespread metastatic disease, particularly if they
are no longer candidates for effective chemotherapy.514 Because many
patients have multifocal bone pain, systemic targeted treatment of skeletal
metastases offers the potential of pain relief with minimal side effects.
Unlike the alpha-emitting agent radium-223, beta emitters confer no
survival advantage and are palliative. Beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals
developed for the treatment of painful bone metastases most commonly
used for prostate cancer include strontium-89 (89Sr) or samarium-153
(153Sm).515,516 The risk of bone marrow suppression, which might influence
the ability to provide additional systemic chemotherapy, should be
considered before this therapy is initiated.

Comparison of Treatment Options for Localized Disease
Several large prospective, population/cohort-based studies have
compared the outcomes of patients with localized prostate cancer treated
with EBRT, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, observation, and/or
active surveillance. Barocas et al compared radical prostatectomy, EBRT,
and active surveillance in 2550 patients and found that, after 3 years,

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
radical prostatectomy was associated with a greater decrease in urinary
and sexual function than either EBRT or active surveillance.517 Active
surveillance, however, was associated with an increase in urinary irritative
symptoms. Health-related QOL measures including bowel and hormonal
function were similar among the groups, as was disease-specific survival.
Chen et al compared radical prostatectomy, EBRT, and brachytherapy
against active surveillance in 1141 patients.518 As in the Barocas study,
radical prostatectomy was associated with greater declines in sexual and
urinary function than other treatments at 3 months. In this study, EBRT
was associated with worse short-term bowel function, and both EBRT and
brachytherapy were associated with worsened urinary obstructive and
irritative symptoms. By 2 years, however, differences among the groups
compared with active surveillance were insignificant. Results of a
systematic review showed similar findings to these studies.519
Another study examined patient-reported outcomes in greater than 2000
patients with localized prostate cancer managed by radical prostatectomy,
brachytherapy, EBRT with or without ADT, or active surveillance.520 By 5
years, most functional differences were minimal between management
approaches. However, radical prostatectomy was associated with worse
incontinence in the full cohort and with worse sexual function in those with
unfavorable intermediate-, high-, or very-high-risk disease than those
managed with EBRT and ADT.

prostatectomy. At this time, the panel recommends only cryosurgery and
high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU; category 2B) as local therapy
options for RT recurrence in the absence of metastatic disease.
Cryosurgery, also known as cryotherapy or cryoablation, is an evolving
minimally invasive therapy that damages tumor tissue through local
freezing. In the initial disease setting, the reported 5-year biochemical
disease-free rate after cryotherapy ranged from 65% to 92% in patients
with low-risk disease using different definitions of biochemical
recurrence.521 A report suggests that cryotherapy and radical
prostatectomy give similar oncologic results for unilateral prostate
cancer.522 A study by Donnelly and colleagues523 randomly assigned 244
patients with T2 or T3 disease to either cryotherapy or EBRT. All patients
received neoadjuvant ADT. There was no difference in 3-year OS or DFS.
Patients who received cryotherapy reported poorer sexual function.524 For
patients with locally advanced cancer, cryoablation was associated with
lower 8-year biochemical progression-free rate compared to EBRT in a
small trial of 62 patients, although disease-specific survival and OS were
similar.525
Cryosurgery has been assessed in patients with recurrent disease after
RT.526-528 In one registry-based study of 91 patients, the biochemical DFS
rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 95.3%, 72.4%, and 46.5%, respectively.
Adverse events included urinary retention (6.6%), incontinence (5.5%),
and rectourethral fistula (3.3%).528

Other Local Therapies
Many therapies have been investigated for the treatment of localized
prostate cancer in the initial disease and recurrent settings, with the goals
of reducing side effects and matching the cancer control of other
therapies. Cryotherapy or other local therapies are not recommended as
routine primary therapy for localized prostate cancer due to lack of longterm data comparing these treatments to radiation or radical

HIFU has been studied for treatment of initial disease.529,530 A prospective
multi-institutional study used HIFU in 111 patients with localized prostate
cancer.529 The radical treatment-free survival rate was 89% at 2 years, and
continence and erectile functions were preserved in 97% and 78% of
patients, respectively, at 12 months. Morbidity was acceptable, with a
grade III complication rate of 13%. In another prospective multiinstitutional study, 625 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated

Morbidity was acceptable, with a grade III/IV complication rate of 3.6%.
Analysis of a separate prospective registry showed that 48% of those who
received HIFU following radiotherapy recurrence were able to avoid ADT
at a median follow-up of 64 months.542
Other emerging local therapies, such as focal laser ablation and vasculartargeted photodynamic (VTP) therapy have also been studied.543,544 The
multicenter, open-label, phase 3, randomized controlled CLIN1001
PCM301 trial compared VTP therapy (IV padeliporfin, optical fibers
inserted into the prostate, and subsequent laser activation) to active
surveillance in 413 patients with low-risk prostate cancer.545 After a median
follow-up of 24 months, 28% of participants in the VTP arm had disease
progression compared with 58% in the active surveillance arm (adjusted
HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.24–0.46; P < .0001). Negative prostate biopsy results
were more prevalent in the VTP group (49% vs. 14%; adjusted RR, 3.67;
95% CI, 2.53–5.33; P < .0001). The most common serious adverse event
in the VTP group was urinary retention (3 of 206 patients), which resolved
within 2 months in all cases.

Disease Monitoring
Please refer to the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship (available at
www.NCCN.org) for recommendations regarding common consequences
of cancer and cancer treatment (eg, cardiovascular disease risk

For patients initially treated with intent to cure, serum PSA levels should
be measured every 6 to 12 months for the first 5 years and then annually.
PSA testing every 3 months may be better for patients at high risk of
recurrence. When prostate cancer recurred after radical prostatectomy,
Pound and colleagues found that 45% of patients experienced recurrence
within the first 2 years, 77% within the first 5 years, and 96% by 10
years.546 Local recurrence may result in substantial morbidity and can, in
rare cases, occur in the absence of a PSA elevation. Therefore, annual
DRE is appropriate to monitor for prostate cancer recurrence and to detect
colorectal cancer. Similarly, after RT, the monitoring of serum PSA levels
is recommended every 6 months for the first 5 years and then annually
and a DRE is recommended annually. The clinician may opt to omit the
DRE if PSA levels remain undetectable.
Patients with Castration-Naïve Disease on ADT
The intensity of clinical monitoring for patients on ADT for castration-naïve
disease is determined by the response to initial ADT, EBRT, or both.
Follow-up evaluation of these patients should include history and physical
examination and PSA measurement every 3 to 6 months based on clinical
judgment. Imaging can be considered periodically to monitor treatment
response. The relative risk for bone metastasis or death increases as
PSADT falls; a major inflection point appears at PSADT of 8 months. Bone
imaging should be performed more frequently in these patients.547
Patients with Localized Disease Under Observation
Patients with localized disease on observation follow the same monitoring
recommendations as patients with castration-naïve disease who are on

ADT, except that the physical exam and PSA measurement should only
be done every 6 months.
Workup for Progression
Castrate levels of testosterone should be documented if clinically indicated
in patients with signs of progression, with adjustment of ADT as
necessary. If serum testosterone levels are <50 ng/dL, the patient should
undergo disease workup with bone and soft tissue imaging (see Imaging
Techniques above for more details):
• Bone imaging can be achieved by conventional technetium-99mMDP bone scan.
o Plain films, CT, MRI, or PET/CT or PET/MRI with F-18
sodium fluoride, C-11 choline, F-18 fluciclovine, Ga-68
PSMA-11, or F-18 PyL PSMA can be considered for
equivocal results on initial bone imaging.
• Soft tissue imaging of pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include
chest CT and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI.
• Alternatively, Ga-68 PSMA-11 or F-18 PyL PSMA PET/CT or
PET/MRI can be considered for bone and soft tissue (full body)
imaging.
o Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of
PSMA-PET tracers for detecting micrometastatic disease
compared to conventional imaging (CT, MRI) at both initial
staging and biochemical recurrence, the Panel does not
feel that conventional imaging is a necessary prerequisite
to PSMA-PET and that PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI
can serve as an equally effective, if not more effective frontline imaging tool for these patients.
ASCO has published guidelines on the optimal imaging strategies for
patients with advanced prostate cancer.548 ASCO recommendations are
generally consistent with those provided here.

Post-Radical Prostatectomy Treatment
Most patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy are cured of
prostate cancer. However, some patients will have adverse pathologic
features, positive lymph nodes, or biochemical persistence or recurrence.
Some patients have detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy due to
benign prostate tissue in the prostate fossa. They have low stable PSAs
and a very low risk of prostate cancer progression.549,550 Serial PSA
measurements can be helpful for stratifying patients at highest risk of
progression and metastases.
Selecting patients appropriately for adjuvant radiation is difficult.
Adjuvant/Early Treatment for Adverse Features
Adjuvant radiation with or without ADT can be given to patients with PSA
persistence (PSA does not fall to undetectable levels) or adverse
pathologic features (ie, positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion,
extracapsular extension) who do not have lymph node metastases.
Positive surgical margins are unfavorable, especially if diffuse (>10-mm
margin involvement or ≥3 sites of positivity) or associated with persistent
serum levels of PSA. The defined target volumes include the prostate
bed.551 Monitoring after radical prostatectomy is also appropriate, with
consideration of early EBRT for a detectable and rising PSA or PSA >0.1
ng/mL.
Decisions about when to initiate post-radical prostatectomy radiation and
whether to include ADT are complex. The Panel recommends use of
nomograms and consideration of age and comorbidities, clinical and
pathologic information, PSA levels, PSADT, and Decipher molecular
assay to individualize treatment discussion. Older trials conducted by
SWOG and EORTC showed that post-prostatectomy adjuvant radiation
improved biochemical PFS in patients with extraprostatic disease at
radical prostatectomy.552-554 More recent randomized trials that used

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
modern surgical and radiation techniques provide high-level evidence that
can be used to counsel patients and are discussed herein.
In the RADICALS-RT trial, 1396 patients with adverse features after
radical prostatectomy were followed for a median 4.9 years and no
differences were seen in 5-year biochemical PFS and freedom from nonprotocol hormone therapy.555 However, urinary incontinence and grade 3–
4 urethral strictures were more frequent in the adjuvant therapy group. The
GETUG-AFU 17 trial and the TROG 08.03/ANZUP RAVES trial were both
terminated early for unexpectedly low event rates, but similarly found no
evidence of oncologic benefit with increased risk of genitourinary toxicity
and erectile dysfunction when adjuvant therapy was used.556,557 Another
randomized trial, however, saw an improvement in 10-year survival for
biochemical recurrence with the use of adjuvant therapy (HR, 0.26; 95%
CI, 0.14–0.48; P < .001).558
Systematic reviews come to conflicting conclusions on the utility of
immediate post-prostatectomy radiation in patients with adverse
features.559,560 A retrospective cohort analysis of more than 26,000 patients
concluded that patients with adverse features after radical prostatectomy
(ie, Gleason 8–10; pT3/4; pN1) should be candidates for adjuvant
radiation because a reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in such
patients.561
A limited amount of data inform the decision regarding the addition of ADT
to EBRT in this setting. The ongoing SPPORT trial (NCT00567580) of
patients with PSA levels between 0.1 and 2.0 ng/mL at least 6 weeks after
radical prostatectomy has reported preliminary results on clinicaltrials.gov.
The primary outcome measure of percentage of participants free from
progression (FFP) at 5 years was 70.3 (95% CI, 66.2–74.3) for those who
received EBRT to the prostate bed and 81.3 (95% CI, 77.9–84.6) for those
who received EBRT with 4 to 6 months of ADT (luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone [LHRH] agonist plus antiandrogen). Results of a

retrospective analysis of radical prostatectomy specimens from patients in
RTOG 9601 suggest that those with low PSA and a low Decipher score
derived less benefit (development of distant metastases, OS) from
bicalutamide than those with a high Decipher score.562 Patients with high
Decipher genomic classifier scores (GC >0.6) should be strongly
considered for EBRT and addition of ADT when the opportunity for early
EBRT has been missed.
Overall, the Panel believes that adjuvant or early EBRT after recuperation
from operation may be beneficial in patients with one or more adverse
laboratory or pathologic features, which include positive surgical margin,
seminal vesicle invasion, and/or extracapsular extension as noted in the
guideline by the American Urological Association (AUA) and ASTRO.563
The value of whole pelvic irradiation in this setting is unclear due to a lack
of benefit in PFS in two trials (RTOG 9413 and GETUG 01)423,424,564,565;
whole pelvic radiation may be appropriate for selected patients.
Adjuvant Therapy for pN1
Adjuvant therapy can also be given to patients with positive lymph nodes
found during or after radical prostatectomy. Several management options
should be considered. ADT is a category 1 option, as discussed below
(see Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for
Regional Disease).566 Retrospective data show that initial observation may
be safe in some patients with N1 disease at radical prostatectomy,
because 28% of a cohort of 369 patients remained free from biochemical
recurrence at 10 years.567 Therefore, another option is monitoring with
consideration of early treatment for a detectable and rising PSA or PSA
>0.1 ng/mL, based further on extrapolation of data from RADICALS-RT,
GETUG-AFU 17, and TROG 08.03/ANZUP RAVES.555-557 A third option is
the addition of pelvic EBRT to ADT (category 2B). This last
recommendation is based on retrospective studies and a National Cancer

Prostate Cancer
Database analysis that demonstrated improved biochemical recurrencefree survival, cancer-specific survival, and all-cause survival with postprostatectomy EBRT and ADT compared to adjuvant ADT alone in
patients with lymph node metastases.568-571
Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy
Patients who experience biochemical recurrence after radical
prostatectomy fall into three groups: 1) those whose PSA level does not
fall to undetectable levels after radical prostatectomy (persistent disease);
2) those who achieve an undetectable PSA after radical prostatectomy
with a subsequent detectable PSA level that increases on two or more
subsequent laboratory determinations (PSA recurrence); or 3) the
occasional case with persistent but low PSA levels attributed to slow PSA
metabolism or residual benign tissue. Consensus has not defined a
threshold level of PSA below which PSA is truly “undetectable.”549 Group 3
does not require further evaluation until PSA increases, but the workup for
1 and 2 must include an evaluation for distant metastases.
Several retrospective studies have assessed the prognostic value of
various combinations of pretreatment PSA levels, Gleason scores,
PSADT, and the presence or absence of positive surgical margins.572-576 A
large retrospective review of 501 patients who received radiation for
detectable and increasing PSA after radical prostatectomy575 showed that
the predictors of progression were Gleason score 8 to 10, pre-EBRT PSA
level >2 ng/mL, seminal vesicle invasion, negative surgical margins, and
PSADT ≤10 months. However, prediction of systemic disease versus local
recurrence and hence responsiveness to postoperative radiation has
proven unfeasible for individual patients using clinical and pathologic
criteria.577 Delivery of adjuvant or post-recurrence EBRT becomes both
therapeutic and diagnostic—PSA response indicates local
persistence/recurrence. Delayed biochemical recurrence requires

restaging, and a nomogram125,578 may prove useful to predict response, but
it has not been validated.
The utility of imaging for patients with an early biochemical recurrence
after radical prostatectomy depends on disease risk before operation and
pathologic stage, Gleason grade, PSA, and PSADT after recurrence.
Patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease and low postoperative
serum PSA levels have a very low risk of positive bone scans or CT
scans.579,580 In a series of 414 bone scans performed in 230 patients with
biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, the rate of a positive
bone scan for patients with PSA >10 ng/mL was only 4%.581
The specific staging tests depend on the clinical history, but should include
a calculation of PSADT to inform nomogram use and counseling. In
addition, bone imaging; chest CT; abdominal/pelvic CT or
abdominal/pelvic MRI; C-11 choline PET/CT or PET/MRI or F-18
fluciclovine PET/CT or PET/MRI; and prostate bed biopsy may be useful.
The Decipher molecular assay can be considered for prognostication after
radical prostatectomy (category 2B). A meta-analysis of five studies with
855 patients and median follow-up of 8 years found that the 10-year
cumulative incidence metastases rates for patients classified as low,
intermediate, and high risk by Decipher after radical prostatectomy were
5.5%, 15.0%, and 26.7%, respectively (P < .001).582
Bone imaging is appropriate when patients develop symptoms or when
PSA levels are increasing rapidly. In one study, the probability of a positive
bone scan for a patient not on ADT after radical prostatectomy was less
than 5% unless the PSA increased to 40 to 45 ng/mL.583 A prostate bed
biopsy may be helpful when imaging suggests local recurrence.
Patients with PSA recurrence (undetectable PSA that increases on two or
more measurements) after radical prostatectomy may be observed or

Prostate Cancer
undergo primary EBRT with or without ADT if distant metastases are not
detected.
Large retrospective cohort studies support the use of EBRT in the setting
of biochemical recurrence, because it is associated with decreased allcause mortality and increased prostate cancer-specific survival.577,584 The
recommended post-radical prostatectomy EBRT dose is 64 to 72 Gy and
may be increased for gross recurrence that has been proven by biopsy.
The target volume includes the prostate bed and may include the whole
pelvis in selected patients.551 Treatment is most effective when pretreatment PSA level is below 0.5 ng/mL.578 Paradoxically, post-recurrence
EBRT was shown to be most beneficial when the PSADT time was less
than 6 months in a cohort analysis of 635 patients,577 although another
study of 519 patients reported mortality reduction for both those with
PSADT less than 6 months and those with PSADT greater than or equal to
6 months.584 Most patients with prolonged PSADT may be observed
safely.585
Six months of concurrent/adjuvant ADT can be coadministered with
radiation in patients with rising PSA levels based on the results of
GETUG-16.586,587 However, a secondary analysis of RTOG 9601 found that
patients with PSA ≤0.6 ng/mL had no OS improvement with the addition of
bicalutamide to EBRT.588 Two years instead of 6 months of ADT can be
considered in addition to radiation for patients with persistent PSA after
radical prostatectomy or for PSA levels that exceed 1.0 ng/mL at the time
of initiation of therapy, based on results of RTOG 9601.589 For 2 years of
ADT, level 1 evidence supports 150 mg bicalutamide daily but an LHRH
agonist could be considered as an alternative.589
ADT alone becomes the treatment when there is proven or high suspicion
for distant metastases after PSA recurrence. Pelvic radiation is not
recommended but may be given to the site of bone metastasis if in weightbearing bones or if the patient is symptomatic. Observation remains

acceptable for selected patients, with ADT delayed until symptoms
develop or PSA levels suggest that symptoms are imminent. In all cases,
the form of primary or secondary systemic therapy should be based on the
hormonal status of the patient.

Post-Radiation Recurrence
The 2006 Phoenix definition was revised by ASTRO and the RTOG in
Phoenix: 1) PSA rise by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir PSA is the
standard definition for biochemical recurrence after EBRT with or without
hormonal therapy; and 2) A recurrence evaluation should be considered
when PSA has been confirmed to be increasing after radiation even if the
rise above nadir is not yet 2 ng/mL, especially in candidates for additional
local therapy who are young and healthy.590 Retaining a strict version of
the ASTRO definition allows comparison with a large existing body of
literature. Rapid increase of PSA may warrant evaluation (prostate biopsy)
prior to meeting the Phoenix definition, especially in younger or healthier
patients.
Workup for RT recurrence typically includes PSADT calculation, bone
imaging, TRUS biopsy, and prostate MRI; in addition, a chest CT, an
abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI, C-11 choline PET/CT or
PET/MRI, or F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered.
Local radiation recurrences are most responsive to additional therapy
when PSA levels at the time of treatment are low (<5 ng/mL). Biopsy
should be encouraged at the time of radiation biochemical recurrence if
staging workup does not reveal metastatic disease. Prostate biopsy in the
setting of suspected local recurrence after radiation should be considered,
including biopsy at the junction of the seminal vesicle and prostate,
because this is a common site of recurrence.

metastases to distant organs and a life expectancy greater than 10 years

Prostate Cancer
include observation or radical prostatectomy with PLND in selected cases
by highly experienced surgeons. Radical prostatectomy after RT
recurrence can result in long-term disease control, but is often associated
with impotence and urinary incontinence.591 Other options for localized
interventions include cryotherapy,592 HIFU (category 2B),534-537,541,542 and
brachytherapy (reviewed by Allen and colleagues593 and discussed in
Post-Recurrence Brachytherapy, above). Treatment, however, needs to
be individualized based on the patient's risk of progression, the likelihood
of success, and the risks involved with therapy. For those with a life
expectancy less than or equal to 10 years, positive biopsy, and no distant
metastases, observation or ADT are appropriate options.

prostate cancer who were not treated with curative intent therapy reported
no survival benefit from primary ADT after adjusting for demographic and
clinical variables.595 Placing patients with early prostate cancer on ADT
should not be routine practice.
Antiandrogen monotherapy (bicalutamide) after completion of primary
treatment was investigated as an adjuvant therapy in patients with
localized or locally advanced prostate cancer, but results did not support
its use in this setting.596,597

Patients with radiographic evidence of distant metastases should proceed
to ADT for castration-naïve disease.

Castrate levels of serum testosterone (<50 ng/dL; <1.7 nmol/L) should be
achieved with ADT, because low nadir serum testosterone levels were
shown to be associated with improved cause-specific survival in the PR-7
study.598 Patients who do not achieve adequate suppression of serum
testosterone (<50 ng/dL) with medical or surgical castration can be
considered for additional hormonal manipulations (with estrogen,
antiandrogens, LHRH antagonists, or steroids), although the clinical
benefit remains uncertain. Monitoring testosterone levels 12 weeks after
first dose of LHRH therapy and upon increase in PSA should be
considered.

Androgen Deprivation Therapy

ADT for Clinically Localized (N0,M0) Disease

ADT is administered as primary systemic therapy for regional or advanced
disease and as neoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant therapy in combination
with radiation in localized or locally advanced prostate cancers.

ADT should not be used as monotherapy in clinically localized prostate
cancer unless there is a contraindication to definitive local therapy, such
as life expectancy less than 5 years and comorbidities. Under those
circumstances, ADT may be an acceptable alternative if the disease is
high or very high risk (see Palliative ADT, below).

Negative TRUS biopsy after post-radiation biochemical recurrence poses
clinical uncertainties. Therefore, mpMRI or full-body PET imaging can be
considered (see Imaging Techniques, above). In the absence of
detectable metastases with a negative biopsy, observation or ADT are
options for patients with PSA recurrence after radiation.

In the community, ADT has been commonly used as primary therapy for
early-stage, low-risk disease, especially in the patients who are older. This
practice has been challenged by a large cohort study of 66,717 patients
≥66 years of age with T1–T2 tumors.594 No 15-year survival benefit was
found in patients receiving ADT compared to observation alone. Similarly,
another cohort study of 15,170 patients diagnosed with clinically localized

In the clinically localized setting, ADT using an LHRH agonist—alone or
with a first-generation antiandrogen—or an LHRH antagonist can be used
as a neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant to EBRT in patients with
unfavorable intermediate-, high-, or very-high-risk prostate cancer, as
described in more detail below.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
ADT used as neoadjuvant treatment before radical prostatectomy is
strongly discouraged outside of a clinical trial.
Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for
Intermediate-Risk Disease

The addition of short-term ADT to radiation improved OS and cancerspecific survival in three randomized trials containing 20% to 60% of
patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (Trans Tasman Radiation
Oncology Group [TROG] 9601, Dana Farber Cancer Institute [DFCI]
95096, and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] 9408).589,599-601
Only a cancer-specific survival benefit was noted in a fourth trial that
recruited mostly patients with high-risk disease (RTOG 8610).602 Results of
the EORTC 22991 trial showed that the addition of 6 months of ADT
significantly improved biochemical DFS compared with radiation alone in
those with intermediate-risk (75% of study population) and high-risk
disease.603 A secondary analysis of the RTOG 9408 trial showed that the
benefit of ADT given with EBRT in patients intermediate-risk prostate
cancer was limited to those in the unfavorable subset.604
RTOG 9910 and RTOG 9902 reinforced two important principles
concerning the optimal duration of ADT and use of systemic
chemotherapy in conjunction with EBRT.605,606 RTOG 9910 is a phase 3
randomized trial targeting patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer
that compared 4 months to 9 months of ADT. RTOG 9408 had previously
shown that 4 months of ADT combined with EBRT improved survival in
those with intermediate-risk disease compared to EBRT alone.601
Consistent with earlier studies, RTOG 9910 demonstrated that there is no
reason to extend ADT beyond 4 months when given in conjunction with
EBRT in patients with intermediate-risk disease.
RTOG 9902 compared long-term ADT and EBRT with and without
paclitaxel, estramustine, and etoposide (TEE) chemotherapy in patients
with locally advanced, high-risk prostate cancer.607 In the randomized

cohort of 397 patients with a median follow-up of 9.2 years, results
demonstrated no significant difference in ADT+EBRT versus
ADT+EBRT+TEE in OS (65% vs. 63%; P = .81), biochemical recurrence
(58% vs. 54%; P = .82), distant metastases (16% vs. 14%; P = .42), or
DFS (22% vs. 26%; P = .61), but a substantial increase in toxicity (3.9%
vs. 0% treatment-related deaths), which resulted in early closure of the
trial.607 Thus, the fact that 6 months of ADT improved survival compared to
EBRT alone does not mean it is better than 4 months of ADT, and the fact
that systemic chemotherapy is effective in one setting (high-volume
metastatic disease or CRPC) should not lead to the assumption that it will
be beneficial in other settings (eg, high-risk localized disease).608,609
At this time, the Panel recommends 4 to 6 months of ADT when EBRT is
given to patients as initial treatment of unfavorable intermediate-risk
prostate cancer. If brachytherapy is added to EBRT in this setting, then 4
to 6 months of ADT is optional.
Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for High-Risk or
Very-High-Risk Disease

ADT combined with EBRT is an effective primary treatment for patients at
high risk or very high risk, as discussed in the Radiation Therapy section
above. Combination therapy was consistently associated with improved
disease-specific survival and OS compared to single-modality treatment in
randomized phase 3 studies.415,416,418,419,610
Increasing evidence favors long-term over short-term
neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT for patients with high- and veryhigh-risk disease. The RTOG 9202 trial included 1521 patients with T2cT4 prostate cancer who received 4 months of ADT before and during
EBRT.611 They were randomized to no further treatment or an additional 2
years of ADT. At 10 years, the long-term group was superior for all
endpoints except OS. A subgroup analysis of patients with a Gleason
score of 8 to 10 found an advantage in OS for long-term ADT at 10 years

Prostate Cancer
(32% vs. 45%, P = .0061). At a median follow-up of 19.6 years, long-term
ADT was superior for all endpoints including OS in the entire cohort (12%
relative reduction; P = .03).612
The EORTC 22961 trial also showed superior survival when 2.5 years of
ADT were added to EBRT given with 6 months of ADT in 970 patients,
most of whom had T2c–T3, N0 disease.613 The DART01/05 GICOR trial
also reported similar results in patients with high-risk disease.614 In a
secondary analysis of RTOG 8531, which mandated lifelong ADT for
patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with EBRT, those
who adhered to the protocol had better survival than those who
discontinued ADT within 5 years.615 Two randomized phase 3 trials
showed 1.5 years of ADT was not inferior to 3 years of ADT.616,617
A meta-analysis of data from 992 patients enrolled in 6 randomized
controlled trials showed that a longer duration of ADT with EBRT benefited
patients with Grade Group 4 or 5 prostate cancer.618
Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for Recurrent
Disease

Patients who develop PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy without
evidence of metastases can receive pelvic EBRT with
neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT (see ADT for M0 Biochemical
Recurrence, below).
ADT for Regional Disease
Primary ADT for Lymph Node Metastases

Patients initially diagnosed with node-positive disease who have a life
expectancy greater than 5 years can be treated with primary ADT. Primary
ADT options are orchiectomy, an LHRH agonist, an LHRH agonist with a
first-generation antiandrogen, or an LHRH antagonist (category 2B); or
orchiectomy, LHRH agonist, or LHRH antagonist with abiraterone. Another
option for these patients is EBRT with 2 to 3 years of

neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT (category 1, see Neoadjuvant,
Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for Regional Disease,
below). For those patients with N1 disease who are treated with radiation
to the prostate and pelvic nodes, abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) with
ADT should be considered for a total of 2 years. Abiraterone should not be
coadministered with an antiandrogen (see Abiraterone Acetate in
Castration-Naïve Prostate Cancer, below).
The EORTC 30846 trial randomized 234 treatment-naïve patients with
node-positive prostate cancer to immediate versus delayed ADT.619 At 13
years median follow-up, the authors reported similar survival between the
two arms, although the study was not powered to show non-inferiority.
Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for Regional
Disease

Patients initially diagnosed with pelvic lymph node-positive disease who
have a life expectancy greater than 5 years can be treated with EBRT with
2 to 3 years of neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT (category 1) with or
without abiraterone. Alternatively, they can receive primary ADT without
EBRT with or without abiraterone (see Primary ADT for Lymph Node
Metastases, above and Abiraterone Acetate in Castration-Naïve Prostate
Cancer, below). Neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT options are an
LHRH agonist, an LHRH agonist with a first-generation antiandrogen, or
an LHRH antagonist. Abiraterone should not be coadministered with an
antiandrogen.
The role of adjuvant ADT after radical prostatectomy is restricted to cases
where positive pelvic lymph nodes are found, although reports in this area
reveal mixed findings. Messing and colleagues randomly assigned 98
patients who were found to have positive lymph nodes at the time of
radical prostatectomy to immediate continuous ADT or observation.566 In
the immediate ADT arm of 47 patients, 30 remained alive, 29 of whom
were prostate cancer recurrence-free and 26 of whom were PSA

Prostate Cancer
recurrence-free after a median follow-up of 11.9 years (range, 9.7–14.5
years for survivors).566,620 Those receiving immediate ADT also had a
significant improvement in OS (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.01–3.35).
However, these results differ from a SEER Medicare, population-based
test of ADT published subsequently.621 The SEER Medicare-based study
of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and had positive lymph
nodes used propensity matching to compare patients who received ADT
within 120 days to those who were observed. The groups had similar
median and range of follow-up for survivors, but OS and prostate cancerspecific survival were similar. The Messing study occurred prior to the
PSA era, but the studies are similar in almost all other respects. The
Messing study showed almost unbelievable benefit, and the populationbased study of 731 patients showed no benefit. Furthermore, a metaanalysis resulted in a recommendation against ADT for pathologic lymph
node metastatic prostate cancer in the ASCO guidelines.622 In addition, a
cohort analysis of 731 patients with positive nodes did not demonstrate a
survival benefit of ADT initiated within 4 months of radical prostatectomy
compared to observation.621 At this time, the Panel recommends that
patients with lymph node metastases found at radical prostatectomy
should be considered for immediate ADT (category 1) with or without
EBRT (category 2B), but that observation is also an option for these
patients.
Palliative ADT
Palliative ADT can be given to patients with a life expectancy of less than
or equal to 5 years who have high-risk, very-high-risk, regional, or
metastatic prostate cancer. Palliative ADT also can be given to patients
with disease progression during observation, usually when symptoms
develop or when changes in PSA levels suggest that symptoms are
imminent. The options in this setting are orchiectomy, LHRH agonist, or
LHRH antagonist (category 2B for LHRH antagonist).

ADT for Castration-Naive Disease
The term “castration-naive" is used to define patients who have not been
treated with ADT and those who are not on ADT at the time of
progression. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel uses the term "castrationnaive" even when patients have had neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or
adjuvant ADT as part of RT provided they have recovered testicular
function. Options for patients with castration-naïve disease who require
ADT depend on the presence of distant metastases, and can be found in
full in the Guidelines algorithm above.
ADT for castration-naïve prostate cancer can be accomplished using
bilateral orchiectomy, an LHRH agonist or antagonist, or an LHRH agonist
plus a first-generation antiandrogen. As discussed below, abiraterone or
docetaxel can be added to orchiectomy, LHRH agonist, or LHRH
antagonist for M1 disease. For patients with M0 disease, observation is
preferred over ADT.
LHRH agonists and LHRH antagonists appear equally effective in patients
with advanced prostate cancer.623
Medical or surgical castration combined with an antiandrogen is known as
combined androgen blockade. No prospective randomized studies have
demonstrated a survival advantage with combined androgen blockade
over the serial use of an LHRH agonist and an antiandrogen.622 Metaanalysis data suggest that bicalutamide may provide an incremental
relative improvement in OS by 5% to 20% over LHRH agonist
monotherapy.624,625 However, others have concluded that more complete
disruption of the androgen axis (with finasteride, dutasteride, or
antiandrogen added to medical or surgical castration) provides little if any
benefit over castration alone.626,627 Combined androgen blockade therapy
adds to cost and side effects, and prospective randomized evidence that
combined androgen blockade is more efficacious than ADT is lacking.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
Antiandrogen monotherapy appears to be less effective than medical or
surgical castration and is not recommended for primary ADT. Furthermore,
dutasteride plus bicalutamide showed no benefit over bicalutamide alone
in patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.628
Recent evidence suggests that orchiectomy may be safer than an LHRH
agonist. Four hundred twenty-nine patients with metastatic prostate cancer
who underwent orchiectomy were compared to 2866 patients who
received LHRH agonist between 1995 and 2009. Orchiectomy was
associated with lower risk of fracture, peripheral arterial disease, and
cardiac-related complications, although risk was similar for diabetes, deep
vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and cognitive disorders.629 Posthoc analysis of a randomized trial of LHRH antagonist versus LHRH
agonist found lower risk of cardiac events in patients with existing cardiac
disease treated with LHRH antagonist.630 The heart and T lymphocytes
have receptors for LHRH. Therefore, LHRH agonists may affect cardiac
contractility, vascular plaque stability, and inflammation.631
A new LHRH antagonist, relugolix, has been studied as ADT in patients
with advanced prostate cancer in the randomized phase 3 HERO trial.632 In
this study, 622 patients received relugolix (120 mg orally once daily) and
308 received leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The
patients had recurrence after primary definitive therapy, newly diagnosed
metastatic castration-naïve disease, or advanced localized disease
deemed unlikely to be cured with definite therapy. The primary endpoint,
sustained castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng per deciliter) through 48
weeks, showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix over leuprolide
(96.7%; 95% CI, 94.9–97.9 vs. 88.8% [95% CI, 84.6–91.8]; P < .001 for
superiority). The secondary endpoint of castrate levels of testosterone on
day 4 was also improved in the relugolix arm (56% vs. 0%). However,
relugolix did not achieve superiority in the key clinical secondary endpoint
of castration resistance-free survival compared to leuprolide (74% vs.

75%; P = .84). The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was
2.9% in the relugolix arm and 6.2% in the leuprolide arm (HR, 0.46; 95%
CI, 0.24–0.88). The Panel includes relugolix alone as an option for ADT in
patients with castration-naïve disease. However, the Panel notes that data
are limited on long-term adherence of oral relugolix and the potential
effects non-adherence may have on optimal ADT. Ongoing monitoring for
sustained suppression of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) can be considered, and
relugolix may not be a preferred agent if adherence is uncertain.
It is important to note that the HERO trial did not include patients receiving
curative intent therapy (ie, individuals getting definitive EBRT plus ADT).
Furthermore, relugolix shows a shorter time to testosterone recovery,
which might be associated with a higher risk of death from prostate
cancer.633 Therefore, although the Panel considers relugolix to be an
acceptable option in the curative-intent setting, additional studies in this
setting are needed.
Patients should be queried about adverse effects related to ADT.
Intermittent ADT should be used for those who experience significant side
effects of ADT (see Intermittent Versus Continuous ADT, below).
ADT for M0 Biochemical Recurrence

Controversy remains about the timing and duration of ADT when disease
persists or recurs after local therapy. Many believe that early ADT is best,
but cancer control must be balanced against side effects. Early ADT is
associated with increased side effects and the potential development of
the metabolic syndrome.
Patients with an increasing PSA level and with no symptomatic or clinical
evidence of cancer after definitive treatment present a therapeutic
dilemma regarding the role of ADT. Some of these patients will ultimately
die of their cancer. Timing of ADT for patients whose only evidence of
cancer is increasing PSA is influenced by PSA velocity (PSADT), patient

Prostate Cancer
and physician anxiety, the short-term and long-term side effects of ADT,
and underlying comorbidities of the patient. Early ADT is acceptable, but
an alternative is close observation until progression of cancer, at which
time appropriate therapeutic options may be considered. Earlier ADT may
be better than delayed therapy, although the definitions of early and late
(ie, what level of PSA) remain controversial. The multicenter phase 3
TROG 03.06/VCOG PR 01-03 [TOAD] trial randomized 293 patients with
PSA relapse after operation or radiation (n = 261) or who were not
considered for curative treatment (n = 32) to immediate ADT or ADT
delayed by a recommended interval of greater than or equal to 2 years.634
Five-year OS was improved in the immediate therapy arm compared with
the delayed therapy arm (91.2% vs. 86.4%; log-rank P = .047). No
significant differences were seen in the secondary endpoint of global
health-related QOL at 2 years.635 In addition, there were no differences
over 5 years in global QOL, physical functioning, role or emotional
functioning, insomnia, fatigue, dyspnea, or feeling less masculine.
However, sexual activity was lower and the hormone treatment-related
symptoms score was higher in the immediate ADT group compared with
the delayed ADT group. Most clinical trials in this patient population
require PSA level ≥0.5 mg/dL (after radical prostatectomy) or “nadir + 2”
(after radiation) for enrollment.
The Panel believes that the benefit of early ADT is uncertain and must be
balanced against the risk of ADT side effects. Patients with an elevated
PSA and/or a shorter PSADT (rapid PSA velocity) and an otherwise long
life expectancy should be encouraged to consider ADT earlier. Patients
who opt for ADT should consider the intermittent approach. The timing of
ADT initiation should be individualized according to PSA velocity, patient
anxiety, and potential side effects. Patients with shorter PSADT or rapid
PSA velocity and long life expectancy may be encouraged to consider
early ADT. Patients with prolonged PSADTs who are older are excellent
candidates for observation.

Primary ADT for M1 Castration-Naïve Prostate Cancer

ADT with treatment intensification is preferred for most patients with
metastatic prostate cancer. ADT alone is appropriate for some patients.622
A PSA value ≤4 ng/mL after 7 months of ADT is associated with improved
survival of patients newly diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer.636
ADT options for M1 castration-naïve disease are:
• Orchiectomy ± docetaxel
• LHRH agonist alone ± docetaxel
• LHRH agonist plus first-generation antiandrogen ± docetaxel
• LHRH antagonist ± docetaxel
• Orchiectomy plus abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide
• LHRH agonist plus abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide
• LHRH antagonist plus abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide
In patients with overt metastases in weight-bearing bone who are at risk of
developing symptoms associated with the flare in testosterone with initial
LHRH agonist alone, antiandrogen therapy should precede or be
coadministered with LHRH agonist for at least 7 days to diminish ligand
binding to the androgen receptor.637,638 LHRH antagonists rapidly and
directly inhibit the release of androgens, unlike LHRH agonists that initially
stimulate LHRH receptors prior to hypogonadism. Therefore, no initial flare
is associated with these agents and coadministration of antiandrogen is
unnecessary.
The data supporting the addition of abiraterone, apalutamide,
enzalutamide, or docetaxel to ADT in this setting are discussed below.
These are all category 1, preferred options; the fine-particle formulation of
abiraterone (discussed in Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC, below) can be
added to ADT as a category 2B option. ADT (LHRH agonist, LHRH
antagonist, or orchiectomy) with EBRT to the primary tumor for low-

volume metastatic disease is discussed in EBRT to the Primary Tumor in
Low-Volume M1 Disease, above.
Abiraterone Acetate in Castration-Naïve Prostate Cancer

In February 2018, the FDA approved abiraterone in combination with
prednisone for metastatic castration-naïve prostate cancer.639,640 This
approval was based on two randomized phase 3 clinical trials of
abiraterone and low-dose prednisone plus ADT that were reported in
patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer or high-risk or
node-positive disease (STAMPEDE and LATITUDE) that demonstrated
improved OS over ADT alone.641 In LATITUDE, 1199 patients with highrisk, metastatic, castration-naïve prostate cancer were randomized to
abiraterone with prednisone 5 mg once daily or matching placebos. Highrisk disease was defined as at least two of the following: Gleason score 8–
10, ≥3 bone metastases, and visceral metastases.641 Efficacy was
demonstrated at the first interim analysis, and the trial was unblinded. The
primary endpoint of OS was met and favored abiraterone (HR, 0.62; 95%
CI, 0.51–0.76; P < .0001). Estimated 3-year OS rates improved from 49%
to 66% at 30 months follow-up. Secondary endpoints were improved and
included delayed castration-resistant radiographic progression (from
median 14.8–33.2 months), PSA progression (7.4–33.2 months), time to
pain progression, and initiation of chemotherapy. After the first interim
analysis, 72 patients crossed over from placebo to abiraterone. Final OS
analysis of LATITUDE after a median follow-up of 51.8 months showed
median OS was significantly longer in the abiraterone group than in the
placebo group (53.3 months vs. 36.5 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56–
0.78; P < .0001).642
Adverse events were higher with abiraterone and prednisone but were
generally mild in nature and largely related to mineralocorticoid excess (ie,
hypertension, hypokalemia, edema), hormonal effects (ie, fatigue, hot
flushes), and liver toxicity.641 Cardiac events, such as atrial fibrillation, were

rare but slightly increased with abiraterone. The overall discontinuation
rate due to side effects was 12%. Patient-reported outcomes were
improved with the addition of abiraterone, with improvements in pain
intensity progression, fatigue, functional decline, prostate cancer-related
symptoms, and overall health-related QOL.643 A limitation of this trial is that
only 27% of placebo-treated patients received abiraterone or enzalutamide
at progression, and only 52% of these patients received any lifeprolonging therapy.641
A second randomized trial (STAMPEDE) of 1917 patients with castrationnaïve prostate cancer demonstrated similar OS benefits.430 However,
unlike LATITUDE, STAMPEDE eligibility permitted patients with high-risk
N0,M0 disease (2 of 3 high-risk factors: stage T3/4, PSA >40, or Gleason
score 8–10; n = 509), or N1,M0 disease (pelvic nodal metastases; n =
369) in addition to M1 patients, who made up the majority of patients (n =
941). The majority of patients were newly diagnosed, while a minority had
recurrent, high-risk, or metastatic disease after local therapy (n = 98).
Thus, STAMPEDE was a heterogeneous mix of patients with high-risk,
non-metastatic, node-positive, or M1 disease. In M1 patients, treatment
with abiraterone plus prednisone was continued until progression. In
patients with N1 or M0 disease, 2 years of abiraterone plus prednisolone
was used if curative-intent EBRT was utilized. OS was improved in the
overall population (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.5–0.76; P < .0001) and in the M1
and N1 subsets, without any heterogeneity of treatment effect by
metastatic status. The survival benefit of abiraterone was larger in patients
<70 years of age than those ≥70 years (HR, 0.94 vs. HR, 0.51). Patients
who were older also suffered increased toxicities, which suggests
heterogeneity in clinical benefits by age and comorbidity. The secondary
endpoint of FFS, which included PSA recurrence, was improved overall
(HR, 0.29; P < .0001) and in all subgroups regardless of M1 (HR, 0.31),
N1 (HR, 0.29), or M0 (HR, 0.21) status. No heterogeneity for FFS was
observed based on subgroups or by age. In this trial, subsequent life-

Prostate Cancer
prolonging therapy was received by 58% of those in the control group,
which included 22% who received abiraterone and 26% who received
enzalutamide. Thus, these data reflect a survival advantage of initial
abiraterone in newly diagnosed patients compared with deferring therapy
to the CRPC setting.
Adverse events in STAMPEDE were similar to that reported in LATITUDE,
but were increased in patients who were older, with higher incidences of
grade 3–5 adverse events with abiraterone (47% vs. 33%) and 9 versus 3
treatment-related deaths. Severe hypertension or cardiac disorders were
noted in 10% of patients and grade 3–5 liver toxicity in 7%, which
illustrates the need for blood pressure and renal and hepatic function
monitoring.
Taken together, these data led the NCCN Panel to recommend
abiraterone with 5-mg once-daily prednisone as a treatment option with
ADT for patients with newly diagnosed, M1, castration-naïve prostate
cancer (category 1). Alternatively, the fine-particle formulation of
abiraterone can be used (category 2B; see Abiraterone Acetate in M1
CRPC, below). For patients undergoing curative-intent treatment for N1
disease, abiraterone can be added to EBRT with 2 to 3 years of
neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT or can be given with ADT for
castration-naïve disease (without EBRT). The fine-particle formulation of
abiraterone is an option (category 2B; see Abiraterone Acetate in M1
CRPC, below). However, there was insufficient survival, FFS data, and
follow-up available to recommend abiraterone for patients with high-risk or
very-high-risk N0 M0 prostate cancer. Further follow-up and dedicated
ongoing clinical trials are needed in this curative-intent RT population.
Abiraterone can be given at 250 mg/day and administered following a lowfat breakfast, as an alternative to the dose of 1000 mg/day after an
overnight fast (see Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC, below).644 The cost
savings may reduce financial toxicity and improve adherence.

Apalutamide in Castration-Naïve Prostate Cancer

The double-blind phase 3 TITAN clinical trial randomized 1052 patients
with metastatic, castration-naïve prostate cancer to ADT with apalutamide
(240 mg/day) or placebo.645 Participants were stratified by Gleason score
at diagnosis, geographic region, and previous docetaxel treatment. The
median follow-up was 22.7 months. Both primary endpoints were met:
radiographic PFS (68.2% vs. 47.5% at 24 months; HR for radiographic
progression or death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39–0.60; P < .001) and OS (82.4%
vs. 73.5% at 24 months; HR for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.89; P = .005).
Adverse events that were more common with apalutamide than with
placebo included rash, hypothyroidism, and ischemic heart disease.
Health-related QOL was maintained during treatment.646 At final analysis of
TITAN, median OS was improved with apalutamide plus ADT compared
with ADT alone after a median follow-up of 44 months (NR vs. 52.2
months; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53–0.79; P < .001)647
Apalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-naïve
prostate cancer. The FDA approved this indication in September of
2019.648,649
Enzalutamide in Castration-Naïve Prostate Cancer

The open-label randomized phase 3 ENZAMET clinical trial compared
enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus ADT (LHRH analog or surgical castration)
with a first-generation antiandrogen (bicalutamide, nilutamide, or
flutamide) plus ADT in 1125 patients with metastatic castration-naïve
prostate cancer.650 Stratification was by volume of disease, planned use of
early docetaxel, planned use of bone anti-resorptive therapy, comorbidity
score, and trial site. The primary endpoint of OS was met at the first
interim analysis with median follow-up of 34 months (HR for death, 0.67;
95% CI, 0.52–0.86; P = .002). Enzalutamide also improved secondary
endpoints, such as PFS using PSA levels and clinical PFS.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
In the double-blind randomized phase 3 ARCHES clinical, 1150 patients
with metastatic castration-naïve prostate cancer were randomized to
receive ADT with either enzalutamide (160 mg/day) or placebo.
Participants were stratified by disease volume and prior docetaxel use.
The primary endpoint was radiographic PFS, which was improved in the
enzalutamide group after a median follow-up of 14.4 months (19.0 months
vs. not reached; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30–0.50; P < .001).651
The safety of enzalutamide in these trials was similar to that seen in
previous trials in the castration-resistant setting. Adverse events
associated with enzalutamide in these trials included fatigue, seizures, and
hypertension.650,651
Enzalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-naïve
prostate cancer.
Intermittent Versus Continuous ADT
ADT is associated with substantial side effects, which generally increase
with the duration of treatment. Intermittent ADT is an approach based on
the premise that cycles of androgen deprivation followed by re-exposure
may delay “androgen independence,” reduce treatment morbidity, and
improve QOL.652,653 Some patients who have no ADT-related morbidity
may find the uncertainty of intermittent ADT not worthwhile. Intermittent
ADT requires close monitoring of PSA and testosterone levels, especially
during off-treatment periods, and patients may need to switch to
continuous therapy upon signs of disease progression.
Intermittent ADT in Non-Metastatic Disease

The Canadian-led PR.7 trial was a phase 3 trial of intermittent versus
continuous ADT in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer who
experienced biochemical recurrence after primary or post-recurrence
EBRT.654 One thousand three hundred eighty-six patients with PSA >3
ng/mL were randomly assigned to intermittent ADT or continuous ADT. At

a median follow-up of 6.9 years, the intermittent approach was non-inferior
to continuous ADT with respect to OS (8.8 vs. 9.1 years, respectively; HR,
1.02; 95% CI, 0.86–1.21). More patients died from prostate cancer in the
intermittent ADT arm (120 of 690 patients) than in the continuous ADT arm
(94 of 696 patients), but this was balanced by more non-prostate cancer
deaths in the continuous ADT arm. Physical function, fatigue, urinary
problems, hot flashes, libido, and erectile dysfunction showed modest
improvement in the intermittent ADT group. The test population was
heterogenous, so it remains unclear which of these asymptomatic patients
benefitted from treatment. It is possible that many of these patients could
have delayed ADT without harm. The test population had a low disease
burden and 59% of deaths in the trial were not related to prostate cancer.
Follow-up longer than 6.9 years may be required for disease-specific
deaths to out-balance deaths by other causes.
An unplanned Cox regression analysis of the trial showed that patients
with Gleason sum greater than 7 in the continuous ADT arm had a median
survival (8 years) that was 14 months longer than those with the same
Gleason sum in the intermittent ADT arm (6.8 years).654 In this situation,
patients should be given the option to weigh the effects of ADT on QOL
against a possible impact on survival, although pathology was not centrally
reviewed and the study was not powered to detect small differences in
survival based on Gleason sum.655
The multinational European ICELAND trial randomized 702 participants
with locally advanced or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer to
continuous or intermittent ADT.656 Clinical outcomes, which included time
to PSA progression, PSA PFS, OS, mean PSA levels over time, QOL, and
adverse events, were similar between the arms.
A 2015 meta-analysis identified 6 randomized controlled trials comparing
continuous with intermittent ADT in patients with locally advanced prostate
cancer and found no difference in mortality and progression and an

Prostate Cancer
advantage of the intermittent approach in terms of QOL and adverse
effects.657
Intermittent ADT in Metastatic Disease

Hussain and colleagues658 conducted the SWOG (Southwest Oncology
Group) 9346 trial to compare intermittent and continuous ADT in patients
with metastatic disease. After 7 months of induction ADT, 1535 patients
whose PSA dropped to 4 ng/mL or below (thereby demonstrating
androgen sensitivity) were randomized to intermittent or continuous ADT.
At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, median survival was 5.1 years for the
intermittent ADT arm and 5.8 years for the continuous ADT arm. The HR
for death with intermittent ADT was 1.10 with a 90% CI between 0.99 and
1.23, which exceeded the prespecified upper boundary of 1.20 for noninferiority. The authors stated that the survival results were inconclusive,
and that a 20% greater mortality risk with the intermittent approach cannot
be ruled out. The study demonstrated better erectile function and mental
health in patients receiving intermittent ADT at 3 months, but the
difference became insignificant thereafter, most likely due to
contamination of assessments of those on the intermittent arm who may
have returned to ADT at the prespecified time points. A secondary
analysis of SWOG 9346 showed that intermittent ADT did not reduce
endocrine, bone, or cognitive events, whereas it increased the incidence
of ischemic and thrombotic events.659
In a post-hoc stratification analysis of the trial, patients with minimal
disease had a median survival of 5.4 years when receiving intermittent
ADT versus 6.9 years when receiving continuous ADT (HR, 1.19; 95% CI,
0.98–1.43).658 The median survival was 4.9 years in the intermittent ADT
arm compared to 4.4 years in the continuous ADT arm for patients with
extensive disease (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.85–1.22). These subgroup
analyses are hypothesis-generating.

A population-based analysis that included 9772 patients with advanced
prostate cancer aged greater than or equal to 66 years showed that
intermittent ADT reduced the risks of total serious cardiovascular events
by 36%, heart failure by 38%, and pathologic fracture by 48%, compared
with continuous ADT.660 Furthermore, several meta-analyses of
randomized controlled trials reported no difference in survival between
intermittent ADT and continuous ADT.661-663 Another recent analysis
concluded that the non-inferiority of intermittent to continuous ADT in
terms of survival has not been clearly demonstrated.664 Still, the
intermittent approach leads to marked improvement in QOL compared to
the continuous approach in most studies, and the Panel believes that
intermittent ADT should be strongly considered.
A more personalized approach could be to treat all patients with metastatic
disease with ADT. After 7 months of ADT, patients can be assigned a risk
category based on the PSA value at that time point636: low risk is defined
by a PSA less than 0.2 ng/mL (median survival of 75 months);
intermediate risk is defined by a PSA between 0.2 and 4.0 ng/mL (median
survival of 44 months), and high risk is defined by a PSA higher than 4.0
ng/mL (median survival of 13 months). Those patients who have few or no
symptoms related to ADT after 7 months of therapy will not benefit from
intermittent ADT in terms of QOL, and therefore continuous ADT is
reasonable because it is easier to administer.655 However, for those
patients with significant side effects impacting QOL, intermittent ADT
should be considered for those with low or intermediate risk after a
discussion about the impact on survival. A final consideration is based on
a subgroup analysis of S9346 that suggested that those who initially
present with pain have better survival on continuous therapy than
intermittent therapy.

Adverse Effects of Traditional ADT

Bone Health During ADT

ADT has a variety of adverse effects including hot flashes, vasomotor
instability, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, shrinkage of penis and
testicles, loss of muscle mass and strength, fatigue, anemia, breast
enlargement and tenderness/soreness, depression and mood swings, hair
loss, osteoporosis, greater incidence of clinical fractures, obesity, insulin
resistance, alterations in lipids, and greater risk for diabetes, acute kidney
injury, and cardiovascular disease.665-667 The intensity and spectrum of
these side effects vary greatly. In general, the side effects of continuous
ADT increase with the duration of treatment. In addition, some forms of
ADT may result in lower risk than others. For example, relugolix was
associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events than
leuprolide in the phase 3 HERO study (also see ADT for Castration-Naïve
Disease, above), although the FDA considered these results in HERO to
be exploratory and therefore did not allow for these data to be included in
the prescribing information for relugolix.632 Overall, very limited prospective
head-to-head studies to date have evaluated the cardiovascular toxicity of
LHRH agonists versus LHRH antagonists as the primary endpoint.

Medical or surgical ADT is associated with greater risk for osteoporosis
and clinical fractures. In large population-based studies, for example, ADT
was associated with a 21% to 54% relative increase in fracture risk.676-678
Longer treatment duration conferred greater fracture risk. Age and
comorbidity also were associated with higher fracture incidence. In a
population-based cohort of 3295 patients, surgical castration was
associated with a significantly lower risk of fractures than medical
castration using an LHRH agonist (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.94;
P = .01).631 ADT increases bone turnover and decreases bone mineral
density,679-682 a surrogate for fracture risk in patients with non-metastatic
disease. Bone mineral density of the hip and spine decreases by
approximately 2% to 3% per year during initial therapy. Most studies have
reported that bone mineral density continues to decline steadily during
long-term therapy. ADT significantly decreases muscle mass,683 and
treatment-related sarcopenia appears to contribute to frailty and increased
risk of falls in patients who are older.

Recent evidence suggests that a link between ADT and cognitive decline,
dementia, or future Alzheimer’s disease may exist, although data are
inconsistent, the risk is low, and the link remains to be proven.668-675
Patients and their medical providers should be advised about these risks
prior to treatment. Many side effects of ADT are reversible or can be
avoided or mitigated. For example, physical activity can counter many of
these symptoms and should be recommended (see NCCN Guidelines for
Survivorship, available at www.NCCN.org). Use of statins also should be
considered.

The NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends screening and treatment for
osteoporosis according to guidelines for the general population from the
National Osteoporosis Foundation.684 A baseline bone mineral density
study should be considered for the patients on ADT. The National
Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines include: 1) calcium (1000–1200 mg
daily from food and supplements) and vitamin D3 (400–1000 IU daily); and
2) additional treatment for males aged greater than or equal to 50 years
with low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5, osteopenia) at the
femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine by dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and a 10-year probability of hip fracture
greater than or equal to 3% or a 10-year probability of a major
osteoporosis-related fracture greater than or equal to 20%. Fracture risk
can be assessed using the algorithm FRAX®, recently released by

Prostate Cancer
WHO.685 ADT should be considered “secondary osteoporosis” using the
FRAX® algorithm.
Earlier randomized controlled trials demonstrated that bisphosphonates
increase bone mineral density, a surrogate for fracture risk, during ADT.686688
In 2011, the FDA approved denosumab as a treatment to prevent bone
loss and fractures during ADT. Denosumab binds to and inhibits the
receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) to blunt osteoclast function
and delay generalized bone resorption and local bone destruction.
Approval was based on a phase 3 study that randomized 1468 patients
with non-metastatic prostate cancer undergoing ADT to either biannual
denosumab or placebo. At 24 months, denosumab increased bone
mineral density by 6.7% and reduced fractures (1.5% vs. 3.9%) compared
to placebo.689 Denosumab also was approved for prevention of SREs in
patients with bone metastasis (see Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, and
Targeted Therapy).
Currently, treatment with denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), zoledronic
acid (5 mg IV annually), or alendronate (70 mg PO weekly) is
recommended when the absolute fracture risk warrants drug therapy. A
baseline DEXA scan before start of therapy and a follow-up DEXA scan
after one year of therapy is recommended by the International Society for
Clinical Densitometry to monitor response. Use of biochemical markers of
bone turnover is not recommended. There are no existing guidelines on
the optimal frequency of vitamin D testing, but vitamin D levels can be
measured when DEXA scans are obtained.
Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease

In a landmark population-based study, ADT was associated with higher
incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.690 After controlling for
other variables, which included age and comorbidity, ADT with an LHRH
agonist was associated with increased risk for new diabetes (HR, 1.44; P
< .001), coronary artery disease (HR, 1.16; P < .001), and myocardial

infarction (HR, 1.11; P = .03). Studies that evaluated the potential
relationship between ADT and cardiovascular mortality have produced
mixed results.602,690-697 In a Danish cohort of 31,571 patients with prostate
cancer, medical castration was associated with an increased risk for
myocardial infarction (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16–1.49) and stroke (HR, 1.19;
95% CI, 1.06–1.35) whereas surgical castration was not.698 Other
population-based studies resulted in similar findings.631,699 However, a
Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database analysis found no
difference in ischemic events with LHRH agonist therapy or
orchiectomy.700 A French database study showed the cardiovascular risk
to be similar in patients taking LHRH agonists and antagonists.701
However, some data suggest that LHRH antagonists might be associated
with a lower risk of cardiac events within 1 year in patients with preexisting
cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial ischemia, coronary artery
disease, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, angina pectoris,
or coronary artery bypass) compared with agonists.630 Patients with a
recent history of cardiovascular disease appear to have higher risk,702 and
increased physical activity may decrease the symptoms and
cardiovascular side effects of patients treated with ADT.703
Several mechanisms may contribute to greater risk for diabetes and
cardiovascular disease during ADT. ADT increases fat mass and
decreases lean body mass.683,704,705 ADT with an LHRH agonist increases
fasting plasma insulin levels706,707 and decreases insulin sensitivity.708 ADT
also increases serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.706,709
ADT may also prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider
whether the benefits of ADT outweigh the potential risks in patients with
congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and frequent
electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong
the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected, and

Prostate Cancer
periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be
considered.
Cardiovascular disease and diabetes are leading causes of morbidity and
mortality in the general population. Based on the observed adverse
metabolic effects of ADT and the association between ADT and higher
incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, screening for and
intervention to prevent/treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease are
recommended for patients receiving ADT. Whether strategies for
screening, prevention, and treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular
disease in patients receiving ADT should differ from those of the general
population remains uncertain.

with continued ADT is an option mainly for patients with shorter PSADT
(≤10 months) as described below, because the androgen receptor may
remain active.
For patients who develop metastatic CRPC, metastatic lesion biopsy is
recommended, as is MSI/MMR testing, if not previously performed. If MSIH or dMMR is found, referral to genetic counseling should be made to
assess for the possibility of Lynch syndrome. These patients should also
have germline and tumor testing to check for mutations in homologous
recombination genes (ie, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA) if not
done previously.712 This information may be used for genetic counseling,
early use of platinum chemotherapy, use of PARP inhibitors, or eligibility
for clinical trials.

Progression to and Management of CRPC
Most patients with advanced disease eventually stop responding to
traditional ADT and are categorized as castration-resistant (also known as
castration-recurrent). CRPC is prostate cancer that progresses clinically,
radiographically, or biochemically despite castrate levels of serum
testosterone (<50 ng/dL).710 Patients whose disease progresses to CRPC
during primary ADT should receive a laboratory assessment to assure a
castrate level of testosterone (<50 ng/dL; <1.7 nmol/L). Imaging tests may
be indicated to monitor for signs of distant metastases. Factors affecting
the frequency of imaging include individual risk, age, overall patient health,
PSA velocity, and Gleason grade.

TMB testing should also be considered for patients with metastatic CRPC
to inform possible use of pembrolizumab in later lines of therapy (see
Pembrolizumab, below).

For patients who develop CRPC, ADT with an LHRH agonist or antagonist
should be continued to maintain castrate serum levels of testosterone
(<50 ng/dL).

ADT is continued in patients with metastatic CRPC while additional
therapies, including secondary hormone therapies, chemotherapies,
immunotherapies, radiopharmaceuticals, and/or targeted therapies, are
sequentially applied, as discussed in the sections that follow; all patients
should receive best supportive care. The Panel defined treatment options
for patients with metastatic CRPC based on previous exposure to
docetaxel and to a novel hormone therapy. Novel hormone therapies
include abiraterone, enzalutamide, darolutamide, or apalutamide received
for metastatic castration-naïve disease, M0 CRPC, or previous lines of
therapy for M1 CRPC.

Patients with CRPC and no signs of distant metastasis on conventional
imaging studies (M0) can consider observation with continued ADT if
PSADT is greater than 10 months (preferred), because these patients will
have a relatively indolent disease history.711 Secondary hormone therapy

The Panel notes that relugolix has not been adequately studied in
combination with potent androgen receptor inhibitors such as
enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, or abiraterone acetate, nor has
it been studied in combination with docetaxel or cabazitaxel

Prostate Cancer
chemotherapy. Potential drug interactions include induction of cytochrome
P450 enzymes and reduced concentration and efficacy of relugolix with
enzalutamide or apalutamide and cardiac QTc interactions with
abiraterone. Further studies of relugolix dosing and drug interactions with
commonly used agents in advanced prostate cancer are needed to ensure
patient safety and proper dosing. Therefore, relugolix is not recommended
in combination with other therapies at this time.
The decision to initiate therapy in the CRPC setting after disease
progression on one or more treatments should be based on the available
high-level evidence of safety, efficacy, and tolerability of these agents and
the application of this evidence to an individual patient. Prior exposures to
therapeutic agents should be considered. There are not much data to
inform the optimal sequence for delivery of these agents in patients with
metastatic CRPC (see Sequencing of Therapy in CRPC, below). Choice of
therapy is based largely on clinical considerations, which include patient
preferences, prior treatment, presence or absence of visceral disease,
symptoms, and potential side effects.
NCCN recommends that patients being treated for CRPC be closely
monitored with radiologic imaging (ie, CT, bone imaging), PSA tests, and
clinical exams for evidence of progression. Therapy should be continued
until clinical progression or intolerability in cases where PSA or bone
imaging changes may indicate flare rather than true clinical
progression.713,714 The sequential use of these agents is reasonable in a
patient who remains a candidate for further systemic therapy. Clinical trial
and best supportive care are additional options.

Secondary Hormone Therapy for CRPC
Research has shown enhancement of autocrine and/or paracrine
androgen synthesis in the tumor microenvironment of patients receiving
ADT.715,716 Androgen signaling consequent to non-gonadal sources of

androgen in CRPC refutes earlier beliefs that CRPC was resistant to
further hormone therapies. The development of novel hormonal agents
demonstrating efficacy in the non-metastatic and metastatic CRPC setting
dramatically changed the paradigm of CRPC treatment.
Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC
In April 2011, the FDA approved the androgen synthesis inhibitor,
abiraterone, in combination with low-dose prednisone, for the treatment of
patients with metastatic CRPC who have received prior chemotherapy
containing docetaxel.
FDA approval in the post-docetaxel, metastatic CRPC setting was based
on the results of a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (COU-AA301) in patients with metastatic CRPC previously treated with docetaxelcontaining regimens.717,718 Patients were randomized to receive either
abiraterone 1000 mg orally once daily (n = 797) or placebo once daily (n =
398), and both arms received daily prednisone. In the final analysis,
median survival was 15.8 versus 11.2 months in the abiraterone and
placebo arm, respectively (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64–0.86; P < .0001).718
Time to radiographic progression, PSA decline, and pain palliation also
were improved by abiraterone.718,719
FDA approval in the pre-docetaxel setting occurred on December 10,
2012, and was based on the randomized phase 3 COU-AA-302 trial of
abiraterone and prednisone (n = 546) versus prednisone alone (n = 542)
in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, metastatic
CRPC.720 Most participants in this trial were not taking narcotics for cancer
pain and none had visceral metastatic disease or prior ketoconazole
exposure. The coprimary endpoint of radiographic PFS was improved by
treatment from 8.3 to 16.5 months (HR, 0.53; P < .001). OS was improved
at final analysis with a median follow-up of 49.2 months (34.7 months vs.
30.3 months; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.93; P = .003).721 Key secondary

Prostate Cancer
endpoints of time to symptomatic deterioration, time to chemotherapy
initiation, time to pain progression, and PSA PFS improved significantly
with abiraterone treatment, and PSA declines (62% vs. 24% with >50%
decline) and radiographic responses (36% vs. 16% RECIST responses)
were more common.
The most common adverse reactions with abiraterone/prednisone (>5%)
were fatigue (39%); back or joint discomfort (28%–32%); peripheral
edema (28%); diarrhea, nausea, or constipation (22%); hypokalemia
(17%); hypophosphatemia (24%); atrial fibrillation (4%); muscle discomfort
(14%); hot flushes (22%); urinary tract infection; cough; hypertension
(22%, severe hypertension in 4%); urinary frequency and nocturia;
dyspepsia; or upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse
drug reactions that resulted in drug discontinuation were increased
aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase (11%–12%),
or cardiac disorders (19%, serious in 6%).
In May 2018, the FDA approved a novel, fine-particle formulation of
abiraterone, in combination with methylprednisolone, for the treatment of
patients with metastatic CRPC.722,723 In studies of healthy males, this
formulation at 500 mg was shown to be bioequivalent to 1000 mg of the
originator formulation.724,725 In a phase 2 therapeutic equivalence study, 53
patients with metastatic CRPC who were not treated previously with
abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223, or chemotherapy (docetaxel for
metastatic CRPC completed ≥1 year prior to enrollment was allowed) were
randomized to 500 mg daily of the new, fine-particle formulation plus 4 mg
methylprednisolone orally twice daily or to 1000 mg of the originator
formulation daily plus 5 mg prednisone orally twice daily.726 Bioequivalence
of these doses was confirmed based on serum testosterone levels, PSA
response, and abiraterone pharmacokinetics. The rates of total and grade
3/4 adverse events were similar between the arms, with musculoskeletal
and connective tissue disorders occurring more frequently in the

originator-treated patients (37.9% vs. 12.5%). The Panel believes that the
fine-particle formulation of abiraterone can be used instead of the original
formulation of abiraterone in the treatment of patients with metastatic
CRPC (category 2A).
Based on the studies described here, abiraterone is a category 1,
preferred option for metastatic CRPC without prior novel hormone therapy.
For patients with metastatic CRPC and prior novel hormone therapy,
abiraterone is included in the other recommended regimens category. The
fine-particle formulation of abiraterone is included under other
recommended options in all metastatic CRPC settings.
Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid (either oral
prednisone 5 mg twice daily or oral methylprednisolone 4 mg twice daily,
depending on which formulation is given) to abrogate signs of
mineralocorticoid excess that can result from treatment. These signs
include hypertension, hypokalemia, and peripheral edema. Thus,
monitoring of liver function, potassium and phosphate levels, and blood
pressure readings on a monthly basis is warranted during abiraterone
therapy. Symptom-directed assessment for cardiac disease also is
warranted, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.
A randomized phase 2 non-inferiority study of 75 patients with M1 CRPC
compared 1000 mg/day abiraterone after an overnight fast with 250
mg/day after a low-fat breakfast.644 The primary endpoint was log change
in PSA, with secondary endpoints of PSA response (≥50%) and PFS. The
primary endpoint favored the low-dose arm (log change in PSA, -1.59 vs. 1.19), as did the PSA response rate (58% vs. 50%), with an equal PFS of
9 months in both arms. Noninferiority of the low dose was established
according to the predefined criteria. Therefore, abiraterone can be given at
250 mg/day administered following a low-fat breakfast, as an alternative to
the dose of 1000 mg/day after an overnight fast in patients who will not
take or cannot afford the standard dose. The cost savings may reduce

financial toxicity and improve adherence. Food impacts absorption
unpredictably; side effects should be monitored and standard dosing
(1000 mg on empty stomach) utilized if excess toxicity is observed on
modified dosing (250 mg with food).

Switching from prednisone to dexamethasone 1 mg/day can be
considered for patients with M1 CRPC with disease progression on either
formulation of abiraterone. Trials show improved PSA responses and PFS
and acceptable safety using this strategy.

radiographic PFS (8.3 vs. 2.9 months), and time to first SRE (16.7 vs. 13.3
months). QOL measured using validated surveys was improved with
enzalutamide compared to placebo. Adverse events were mild, and
included fatigue (34% vs. 29%), diarrhea (21% vs. 18%), hot flushes (20%
vs. 10%), headache (12% vs. 6%), and seizures (0.6% vs. 0%). The
incidence of cardiac disorders did not differ between the arms.
Enzalutamide is dosed at 160 mg daily. Patients in the AFFIRM study
were maintained on LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy and could receive
bone supportive care medications. The seizure risk in the enzalutamide
FDA label was 0.9% versus 0.6% in the manuscript.729,731

The SWITCH study was a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study of this
approach with 26 enrolled patients.727 The primary endpoint, the proportion
of patients with a PSA decline ≥30% in 6 weeks, was 46.2%. No
significant toxicities were observed, and two radiologic responses were
seen. In another study, 48 consecutive patients with mCRPC, with disease
progression on abiraterone with prednisone, were switched to abiraterone
with 0.5 mg/day dexamethasone.728 The primary endpoint of median PFS
was 10.35 months, and PSA levels decreased or stabilized in 56% of
patients after switching to dexamethasone.

Another phase 3 trial studied enzalutamide in the pre-chemotherapy
setting. The PREVAIL study randomly assigned 1717 patients with
chemotherapy-naïve metastatic prostate cancer to daily enzalutamide or
placebo.733,734 The study was stopped early due to benefits shown in the
treatment arm. Compared to the placebo group, the enzalutamide group
showed improved median PFS (20.0 months vs. 5.4 months) and median
OS (35.3 months vs. 31.3 months). Improvements in all secondary
endpoints were also observed (eg, the time until chemotherapy initiation or
first SRE).

Enzalutamide in M0 and M1 CRPC

Two randomized clinical trials have reported that enzalutamide may be
superior to bicalutamide for cancer control in metastatic CRPC. The
TERRAIN study randomized 375 patients with treatment-naïve, metastatic
CRPC to 160 mg/day enzalutamide or 50 mg/day bicalutamide in a 1:1
manner.735 The enzalutamide group had significantly better PFS (defined
as PSA progression, soft tissue progression, or development of additional
bony metastases) compared to the bicalutamide group (median time to
progression, 15.7 vs. 5.8 months; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.34–0.57).

Abiraterone with Dexamethasone in M1 CRPC

On August 31, 2012, the FDA approved enzalutamide, a next-generation
antiandrogen, for treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC who had
received prior docetaxel chemotherapy.729,730 Approval was based on the
results of the randomized, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial (AFFIRM).731,732
AFFIRM randomized 1199 patients to enzalutamide or placebo in a 2:1
ratio and the primary endpoint was OS. Median survival was improved
with enzalutamide from 13.6 to 18.4 months (HR, 0.63; P < .001). Survival
was improved in all subgroups analyzed. Secondary endpoints also were
improved significantly, which included the proportion of patients with >50%
PSA decline (54% vs. 2%), radiographic response (29% vs. 4%),

The STRIVE trial randomized 396 patients with M0 or M1 treatment-naïve
CRPC to 160 mg/day enzalutamide or 50 mg/day bicalutamide in a 1:1
manner.736 The primary endpoint in this study was PFS, defined as either

Prostate Cancer
PSA progression, radiographic progression of disease, or death from any
cause. Enzalutamide reduced the risk of progression or death by 76%
compared to bicalutamide (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.18–0.32). These studies
demonstrated that enzalutamide extended PFS better than bicalutamide in
patients choosing an antiandrogen for secondary hormonal therapy
treatment of CRPC. Bicalutamide can still be considered in some patients,
given the different side-effect profiles of the agents and the increased cost
of enzalutamide.
Thus, enzalutamide represents a category 1, preferred treatment option
for patients without prior novel hormone therapy in the metastatic CRPC
setting. For patients with metastatic CRPC and prior novel hormone
therapy, enzalutamide is included in the other recommended regimens
group of options.
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 PROSPER trial
assessed the use of enzalutamide in 1401 patients with non-metastatic
CRPC.737 Patients with PSADT less than or equal to 10 months were
stratified according to PSADT (<6 months vs. ≥6 months) and use of bonesparing agents and randomized 2:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus
ADT or placebo plus ADT. Enzalutamide improved the primary endpoint of
metastasis-free survival over placebo (36.6 months vs. 14.7 months; HR
for metastasis or death, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.24–0.35; P < .0001). Median OS
was longer in the enzalutamide group than in the placebo group (67.0
months vs. 56.3 months; HR for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.89; P =
0.001).738 Adverse events included fatigue (33% vs. 14%), hypertension
(12% vs. 5%), major adverse cardiovascular events (5% vs. 3%), and
mental impairment disorders (5% vs. 2%). Patient-reported outcomes from
PROSPER indicate that enzalutamide delayed pain progression, symptom
worsening, and decrease in functional status, compared with placebo.739
The FDA expanded approval for enzalutamide to include patients with
non-metastatic CRPC on July 13, 2018,729,730 and the Panel believes that

patients with M0 CRPC can be offered enzalutamide, if PSADT is less
than or equal to 10 months (category 1, preferred).
Patients receiving enzalutamide have no restrictions for food intake and
concurrent prednisone is permitted but not required.731
Apalutamide in M0 CRPC
The FDA approved apalutamide for treatment of patients with nonmetastatic CRPC on February 14, 2018.648 This approval was based on
the phase 3 SPARTAN trial of 1207 patients with M0 CRPC and PSADT
less than or equal to 10 months.740 Participants were stratified according to
PSADT (>6 months vs. ≤6 months), use of bone-sparing agents, and the
presence of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (N0 vs. N1). After a median
follow-up of 20.3 months, apalutamide at 240 mg/day with ADT improved
the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival over placebo with ADT
(40.5 months vs. 16.2 months; HR for metastasis or death, 0.28; 95% CI,
0.23–0.35; P < .001). Adverse events included rash (24% vs. 5.5%),
fracture (11% vs. 6.5%), and hypothyroidism (8% vs. 2%). Patients with
M0 CRPC can be offered apalutamide, if PSADT is less than or equal to
10 months (category 1). In a prespecified exploratory analysis of
SPARTAN, health-related QOL was maintained in both the apalutamide
and placebo groups.741
After a median follow-up of 52 months, final OS analysis showed that
participants in SPARTAN experienced an improved median OS with
apalutamide versus placebo (73.9 months vs. 59.9 months; HR, 0.78; 95%
CI, 0.64–0.96; P = .016).742 This longer OS reached prespecified statistical
significance, even though 19% of participants crossed over from placebo
to apalutamide.
Apalutamide is a category 1, preferred option for patients with M0 CRPC if
PSADT is less than or equal to 10 months.

Darolutamide in M0 CRPC
The FDA approved darolutamide for treatment of patients with nonmetastatic CRPC on July 30, 2019.743,744 The phase 3 ARAMIS study
randomized 1509 patients with M0 CRPC and PSADT less than or equal
to 10 months 2:1 to darolutamide (600 mg twice daily) or placebo.745
Participants were stratified according to PSADT (>6 months vs. ≤6
months) and the use of osteoclast-targeted agents. The median follow-up
time was 17.9 months. Darolutamide improved the primary endpoint of
metastasis-free survival compared to placebo (40.4 months vs. 18.4
months; HR for metastasis or death, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.34–0.50; P < .001).
Patients in the placebo group of ARAMIS crossed over to darolutamide (n
= 170) or received other life-prolonging therapy (n = 137). Final analysis
occurred after a median follow-up time of 29.0 months. The risk of death
was 31% lower in the darolutamide group than in the placebo group (HR
for death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.88; P = .003).746 OS at 3 years was 83%
(95% CI, 80–86) in the darolutamide group compared with 77% (95% CI,
72–81) in the placebo group. Adverse events that occurred more
frequently in the treatment arm included fatigue (12.1% vs. 8.7%), pain in
an extremity (5.8% vs. 3.2%), and rash (2.9% vs. 0.9%). The incidence of
fractures was similar between darolutamide and placebo (4.2% vs.
3.6%).745
Darolutamide is a category 1, preferred option for patients with M0 CRPC
if PSADT is less than or equal to 10 months.
Other Secondary Hormone Therapies
Other options for secondary hormone therapy include a first-generation
antiandrogen, antiandrogen withdrawal, corticosteroid, or ketoconazole
(adrenal enzyme inhibitor) with hydrocortisone.747-749 However, none of
these strategies has yet been shown to prolong survival in randomized
clinical trials.

A randomized phase 2 trial, TRANSFORMER, compared the effect of
bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) with that of enzalutamide on PFS in 195
patients with asymptomatic, metastatic CRPC with prior progression on
abiraterone.750 BAT involves rapid cycling between high and low serum
testosterone to disrupt the adaptive upregulation of the androgen receptor
that occurs with low testosterone levels. Patients in the BAT arm received
testosterone cypionate 400 mg intramuscularly once every 28 days. The
PFS was 5.7 months in both arms (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.83–1.55; P = .42).
Crossover was allowed after disease progression, and OS was similar
between the groups. BAT resulted in more favorable patient-reported
QOL. The Panel awaits more data on this approach.

Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, and Targeted Therapy in
Metastatic Prostate Cancer
Recent research has expanded the therapeutic options for patients with
metastatic CRPC depending on the presence or absence of symptoms,
the location of metastases, and the presence of certain biomarkers.
Docetaxel
Two randomized phase 3 studies evaluated docetaxel-based regimens in
symptomatic or rapidly progressive CRPC (TAX 327 and SWOG
9916).609,751,752 TAX 327 compared docetaxel (every 3 weeks or weekly)
plus prednisone to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in 1006 patients.751
Every-3-week docetaxel resulted in higher median OS than mitoxantrone
(18.9 vs. 16.5 months; P = .009). This survival benefit was maintained at
extended follow-up.752 The SWOG 9916 study also showed improved
survival with docetaxel when combined with estramustine compared to
mitoxantrone plus prednisone.609
Docetaxel is FDA-approved for metastatic CRPC. The standard regimen is
every 3 weeks. An alternative to every-3-week docetaxel is a biweekly
regimen of 50 mg/m2. This regimen is based on a large randomized phase

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
2 trial of 346 patients with metastatic CRPC randomized to either every-2week docetaxel or every-3-week docetaxel, each with maintenance of
ADT and prednisone.753 Patients treated with the every-2-week regimen
survived an average of 19.5 months compared to 17.0 months with the
every-3-week regimen (P = .015). Time-to-progression and PSA decline
rate favored every-2-week therapy. Tolerability was improved with every2-week docetaxel; febrile neutropenia rate was 4% versus 14% and other
toxicities and overall QOL were similar.
Docetaxel is the traditional mainstay of treatment for symptomatic
metastatic CRPC. Docetaxel is not commonly used for asymptomatic
patients in this setting, but may be considered when the patient shows
signs of rapid progression or visceral metastases despite lack of
symptoms. Treatment with greater than or equal to 8 cycles of docetaxel
may be associated with better OS than fewer cycles in the metastatic
CRPC setting, but prospective trials are necessary to test 6 versus 10
cycles of docetaxel in the metastatic castration-naïve and CRPC
settings.754 Retrospective analysis from the GETUG-AFU 15 trial suggests
that docetaxel only benefits some patients with CRPC who received
docetaxel in the castration-naïve setting.755
Thus, docetaxel is a category 1 preferred option for treatment of
docetaxel-naïve metastatic CRPC. The Panel believes that docetaxel can
be given as a rechallenge after progression on a novel hormone in the
metastatic CRPC setting if given in the castration-naive setting.
Docetaxel is also included as an upfront option for patients with castrationnaïve prostate cancer and distant metastases based on results from two
phase 3 trials (ECOG 3805/CHAARTED and STAMPEDE).429,756
CHAARTED randomized 790 patients with metastatic, castration-naïve
prostate cancer to docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV q3 weeks x 6 doses) plus ADT
or ADT alone.756 After a median follow-up of 53.7 months, the patients in
the combination arm experienced a longer OS than those in the ADT arm

(57.6 months vs. 47.2 months; HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59–0.89; P = .002).757
Subgroup analysis showed that the survival benefit was more pronounced
in the 65% of participants with high-volume disease (HR, 0.63; 95% CI,
0.50–0.79; P < .001). Patients with low-volume disease in CHAARTED did
not derive a survival benefit from the inclusion of docetaxel (HR, 1.04;
95% CI, 0.70–1.55; P = .86).
The STAMPEDE trial, a multi-arm, multi-stage phase 3 trial, included
patients with both M0 and M1 castration-naïve prostate cancer.429 The
results in the M1 population essentially confirmed the survival advantage
of adding docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV q3 weeks x 6 doses) to ADT seen in the
CHAARTED trial. In STAMPEDE, extent of disease was not evaluated in
the 1087 patients with metastatic disease, but the median OS for all
patients with M1 disease was 5.4 years in the ADT-plus-docetaxel arm
versus 3.6 years in the ADT-only arm (a difference of 1.8 years between
groups compared with a 1.1-year difference in CHAARTED). The results
of the STAMPEDE trial seem to confirm the results of the CHAARTED
trial.
Patients with low-volume metastatic disease can be offered early
treatment with docetaxel combined with ADT; however, they have less
certain benefit from treatment than patients with higher-volume disease,
as this subgroup did not have definitively improved survival outcomes in
the ECOG CHAARTED study or a similar European trial (GETUG-AFU
15).756,758,759 Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials also concluded
that docetaxel provides a significant OS benefit in this setting, with no
evidence that the benefit was dependent on the volume of disease.760-762
The direct randomized comparison of docetaxel with ADT and abiraterone
with ADT in STAMPEDE showed that the two treatment options resulted in
similar efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with metastatic castrationnaïve prostate cancer.431

Prostate Cancer
Cabazitaxel
In June 2010, the FDA approved cabazitaxel, a semi-synthetic taxane
derivative, for patients with metastatic CRPC previously treated with a
docetaxel-containing regimen. An international randomized phase 3 trial
(TROPIC) randomized 755 patients with progressive metastatic CRPC to
receive cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2, each with daily
prednisone.763 A 2.4-month improvement in OS was demonstrated with
cabazitaxel compared to mitoxantrone (HR, 0.72; P < .0001). The
improvement in survival was balanced against a higher toxic death rate
with cabazitaxel (4.9% vs. 1.9%), which was due, in large part, to
differences in rates of sepsis and renal failure. Febrile neutropenia was
observed in 7.5% of cabazitaxel-treated patients versus 1.3% of
mitoxantrone-treated patients. The incidences of severe diarrhea (6%),
fatigue (5%), nausea/vomiting (2%), anemia (11%), and thrombocytopenia
(4%) also were higher in cabazitaxel-treated patients, which indicated the
need for vigilance and treatment or prophylaxis in this setting to prevent
febrile neutropenia. The survival benefit was sustained at an updated
analysis with a median follow-up of 25.5 months.764 Furthermore, results of
a post-hoc analysis of this trial suggested that the occurrence of grade ≥3
neutropenia after cabazitaxel treatment was associated with
improvements in both PFS and OS.765
The phase 3 open-label, multinational, non-inferiority PROSELICA study
compared 20 mg/m2 cabazitaxel with 25 mg/m2 cabazitaxel in 1200
patients with metastatic CRPC who progressed on docetaxel.766 The lower
dose was found to be noninferior to the higher dose for median OS (13.4
months [95% CI, 12.19–14.88] vs. 14.5 months [95% CI, 13.47–15.28]),
and grade 3/4 adverse events were decreased (39.7% vs. 54.5%). In
particular, grade ≥3 neutropenia rates were 41.8% and 73.3% for the
lower and higher dose groups, respectively. Cabazitaxel at 20 mg/m2
every 3 weeks, with or without growth factor support, is now

recommended for fit patients. Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 may be considered
for healthy patients who wish to be more aggressive.
Recent results from the phase 3 FIRSTANA study suggested that
cabazitaxel has clinical activity in patients with chemotherapy-naïve
mCRPC.767 Median OS, the primary endpoint, was similar between 20
mg/m2 cabazitaxel, 25 mg/m2 cabazitaxel, and 75 mg/m2 docetaxel (24.5
months, 25.2 months, and 24.3 months, respectively). Cabazitaxel was
associated with lower rates of peripheral sensory neuropathy than
docetaxel, particularly at 20 mg/m2 (12% vs. 25%). Therefore, patients
who are not candidates for docetaxel, who are intolerant of docetaxel, or
who have pre-existing mild peripheral neuropathy should be considered
for cabazitaxel.767
The NCCN Guidelines Panel included cabazitaxel as an option after
progression on docetaxel for patients with symptomatic metastatic CRPC.
This recommendation is category 1 in patients who also had prior
treatment with a novel hormone therapy based on randomized phase 3
study data (see Cabazitaxel, above).763,767 NCCN panelists agreed that
docetaxel rechallenge may be useful in some patients (category 2A
instead of category 1 in this setting), especially in those who have not
shown definitive evidence of progression on prior docetaxel therapy.
Docetaxel rechallenge can be considered in patients who received
docetaxel with ADT in the metastatic castration-naïve setting.
The multicenter CARD study was a randomized, open-label clinical trial
that compared cabazitaxel with either abiraterone or enzalutamide in 255
patients with metastatic CRPC who had previously received docetaxel and
either abiraterone or enzalutamide.768 Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 with
concurrent steroid improved the primary endpoint of radiographic PFS (8.0
vs. 3.7 months; HR, 0.54; P < .0001) and reduced the risk of death (13.6
vs. 11.0 months; HR, 0.64; P = .008) compared with abiraterone or
enzalutamide in these patients. Cabazitaxel was also associated with an

Prostate Cancer
increased rate of pain response and delayed time to pain progression and
SREs.769 Therefore, cabazitaxel is included in these Guidelines as a
preferred option after progression occurs on docetaxel in patients with
metastatic CRPC (category 1 after progression on docetaxel and a novel
hormone therapy).
Cabazitaxel should be given with concurrent steroids (daily prednisone or
dexamethasone on the day of chemotherapy). Physicians should follow
current guidelines for prophylactic white blood cell growth factor use,
particularly in this heavily pre-treated, high-risk population. In addition,
supportive care should include antiemetics (prophylactic antihistamines,
H2 antagonists, and corticosteroids prophylaxis) and symptom-directed
antidiarrheal agents. Cabazitaxel was tested in patients with hepatic
dysfunction in a small, phase I, dose-escalation study.770 Cabazitaxel was
tolerated in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. However,
cabazitaxel should not be used in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.
Cabazitaxel should be stopped upon clinical disease progression or
intolerance.
Cabazitaxel/Carboplatin
Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² plus carboplatin AUC 4 mg/mL per minute with
growth factor support can be considered for fit patients with aggressive
variant metastatic CRPC (visceral metastases, low PSA and bulky
disease, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA), lytic bone metastases, NEPC histology) or unfavorable
genomics (defects in at least 2 of PTEN, TP53, and RB1). This
recommendation is based on a phase 1–2, open label, randomized
study.771 In the phase 2 portion, 160 patients were randomized to receive
cabazitaxel alone or with carboplatin, and the primary endpoint was
investigator-assessed PFS. In the intention-to-treat population, median
PFS was 4.5 months in the cabazitaxel arm versus 7.3 months in the
cabazitaxel/carboplatin arm (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50–0.95; P = .018). The

most common grade 3–5 adverse events (fatigue, anemia, neutropenia,
and thrombocytopenia) were all more common in the combination arm.
Post-hoc analyses showed that patients with aggressive variant disease
had a longer median PFS in the combination arm than the cabazitaxel arm
(7.5 vs. 1.7 months; P = .017). Patients without aggressive variant tumors,
on the other hand, had similar median PFS regardless of treatment (6.5
vs. 6.3 months; P = .38).
Sipuleucel-T
In April 2010, sipuleucel-T became the first in a new class of cancer
immunotherapeutic agents to be approved by the FDA. This autologous
cancer “vaccine” involves collection of the white blood cell fractioncontaining, antigen-presenting cells from each patient; exposure of the
cells to the prostatic acid phosphatase-granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor (PAP-GM-CSF recombinant fusion protein); and
subsequent reinfusion of the cells. The pivotal study was a phase 3,
multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial (D9902B).772 Five hundred
twelve patients with minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic metastatic
CRPC were randomized 2:1 to receive sipuleucel-T or placebo. Eighteen
point two percent of patients had received prior chemotherapy, which
included docetaxel; eligibility requirements included no chemotherapy for 3
months and no steroids for 1 month prior to enrollment. Median survival in
the vaccine arm was 25.8 months compared to 21.7 months in the control
arm. In a subset analysis, both those who did and those who did not
receive prior chemotherapy benefited from sipuleucel-T treatment.
Sipuleucel-T treatment resulted in a 22% reduction in mortality risk (HR,
0.78; 95% CI, 0.61–0.98; P = .03). Common complications included mild
to moderate chills (54.1%), pyrexia (29.3%), and headache (16.0%), which
usually were transient.
A prospective registry of patients with metastatic CRPC, PROCEED,
enrolled 1976 patients from 2011 to 2017, who were followed for a median

Prostate Cancer
of 46.6 months.773 The safety and tolerability of sipuleucel-T were
consistent with previous findings, and the median OS was 30.7 months
(95% CI, 28.6–32.2 months).
Sipuleucel-T is a category 1 option for certain patients with metastatic
CRPC who have not had previous treatment with docetaxel or with a novel
hormone therapy. Benefit of sipuleucel-T has not been reported in patients
with visceral metastases and is not recommended if visceral metastases
are present. Sipuleucel-T is also not recommended for patients with small
cell/neuroendocrine prostate cancer. The Panel prefers that sipuleucel-T
be used as initial therapy for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic
patients with metastatic CRPC, so that disease burden is lower and
immune function is potentially more intact. However, it is also an option for
patients with metastatic CRPC who have had prior treatment with
docetaxel or a novel hormone therapy, but not for patients who have
already received both. Patients should have good performance level
(ECOG 0-1), estimated life expectancy greater than 6 months, and no liver
metastases. Clinicians and patients should be aware that the usual
markers of benefit (decline in PSA and improvement in bone or CT scans)
are not seen. Therefore, benefit to the individual patient cannot be
ascertained using currently available testing.
Treatment subsequent to sipuleucel-T treatment should proceed as
clinically indicated, particularly if symptoms develop.
Pembrolizumab
The FDA approved the use of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 antibody, for
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR solid
tumors who have progressed on prior treatment and who have no
satisfactory alternative treatment options on May 23, 2017.774 The
indication has since been expanded to include several cancer types, but
not prostate cancer specifically.775 The recommended adult doses of

pembrolizumab for this indication are 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg
every 6 weeks administered intravenously.
FDA-accelerated approval was based on the treatment of 149 patients
across five clinical studies involving MSI-H or dMMR colorectal (n = 90) or
non-colorectal (n = 59) cancer for an objective response rate of 40%
(59/149).774 All patients received greater than or equal to 1 prior regimen.
Among the non-colorectal cohorts, two patients had metastatic CRPC: one
achieved a partial objective response, and the other achieved stable
disease for greater than 9 months.
A growing number of additional patients with metastatic CRPC treated with
pembrolizumab have been reported.79,776-780 In an early study, 10 patients
with CRPC and non-visceral metastases (bone = 7; lymph nodes = 2;
bone and liver = 1) who had disease progression on enzalutamide were
treated with pembrolizumab and enzalutamide.776 Some of the patients
also had experienced disease progression on additional therapies
(docetaxel for castration-naïve disease, abiraterone, and/or sipuleucel-T).
Three of the 10 patients showed a near complete PSA response. Two of
these three patients had radiographically measurable disease and
achieved a partial radiographic response (including a response in liver
metastases). Of the remaining patients, three showed stable disease, and
four displayed no evidence of clinical benefit. Genetic analysis of biopsy
tissue from two PSA responders and two PSA non-responders revealed
that one responder had an MSI-H tumor, whereas the other responder and
the non-responders did not. The nonrandomized phase Ib KEYNOTE-028
trial included 23 patients with advanced, progressive prostate cancer, of
whom 74% had received greater than or equal to two previous therapies
for metastatic disease.778 The objective response rate by investigator
review was 17.4% (95% CI, 5.0%–38.8%), with four confirmed partial
responses. Eight patients (34.8%) had stable disease. Treatment-related
adverse events occurred in 61% of patients after a median follow-up of

Prostate Cancer
7.9 months; 17% of the cohort experienced grade 3/4 events (ie, grade 4
lipase increase, grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, grade 3 asthenia, grade 3
fatigue).
KEYNOTE-199 was a multi-cohort, open-label phase II study in 258
patients with metastatic CRPC and prior treatment with docetaxel and at
least one novel hormonal therapy that assessed pembrolizumab in
patients regardless of MSI status.781 Cohorts 1 and 2 included patients with
PD-L1–positive (n = 133) and PD-L1–negative (n = 66) prostate cancer,
respectively. Cohort 3 included those with bone-predominant disease with
positive or negative PD-L1 expression (n = 59). The primary endpoint of
ORR in cohorts 1 and 2 was 5% (95% CI, 2%–11%) in cohort 1 and 3%
(95% CI, <1%–11%) in cohort 2. Responses were durable (range, 1.9 –
≥21.8 months).
The most common adverse events from pembrolizumab are fatigue,
pruritus, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, nausea, rash, fever, cough,
dyspnea, and musculoskeletal pain. Pembrolizumab also may be
associated with immune-mediated side effects, which include colitis,
hepatitis, endocrinopathies, pneumonitis, or nephritis.
Based on the available data, the Panel supports the use of pembrolizumab
in patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic CRPC whose disease has
progressed through at least one line of systemic therapy for M1 CRPC.
The prevalence of MMR deficiency in metastatic CPRC is estimated at 2%
to 5%,43,777 and testing for MSI-H or dMMR can be performed using DNA
testing or immunohistochemistry. If tumor MSI-H or dMMR is identified, the
Panel recommends referral to genetic counseling for consideration of
germline testing for Lynch syndrome.
In June 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval for pembrolizumab’s
use in patients with unresectable or metastatic TMB-high (TMB-H) [≥10
mutations/megabase (mut/Mb)] solid tumors that have progressed

following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative
treatment options.775 Results from prospective biomarker analysis of the
multicohort, non-randomized, open-label, phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 trial
support this approval.782 This trial included 233 evaluable patients with
unresectable or metastatic solid tumors, 6 of whom had prostate cancer.780
The prospective TMB study included patients with anal, biliary, cervical,
endometrial, mesothelioma, neuroendocrine, salivary, small-cell lung,
thyroid, and vulvar cancer. Objective responses to pembrolizumab were
seen in 30 of 102 patients in the TMB-high group (29%; 95% CI, 21%–
39%) and 43 of 688 patients in the non–TMB-high group (6%; 95% CI,
5%–8%). Safety was as expected based on other studies of
pembrolizumab. Therefore, the Panel includes pembrolizumab as an
option for patients with metastatic CRPC, prior docetaxel and/or novel
hormone therapy, and TMB >10 mut/Mb.
Mitoxantrone
Two randomized trials assessed the role of mitoxantrone in patients with
metastatic CRPC.783,784 Although there was no improvement in OS,
palliative responses and improvements in QOL were seen with
mitoxantrone.
Mitoxantrone can be used for palliation in symptomatic patients with
metastatic CRPC who cannot tolerate other therapies after disease
progression on prior docetaxel.
Treatment Options for Patients with DNA Repair Gene Mutations
Early studies suggest germline and somatic mutations in homologous
recombination repair (HRR) genes (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2,
FANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2) may be predictive of the clinical benefit of
poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.785-787 PARP inhibitors are
oral agents that exert their activity through the concept of synthetic

lethality.788 At present, two PARP inhibitors are approved by the FDA for
use in prostate cancer (see Olaparib and see Rucaparib, below).789,790
DNA repair defects have also been reported to be predictive for sensitivity
to platinum agents in CRPC and other cancers.791-795 Platinum agents have
shown some activity in patients with CRPC without molecular selection.796
Studies of platinum agents in patients with CRPC that have DNA repair
gene mutations are needed.
In addition, a recent study suggested that patients with metastatic CRPC
and germline mutations in DNA repair genes may have better outcomes if
treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide than with taxanes.51 However, it
should be noted that the response of patients with metastatic CRPC and
HRR gene mutations to standard therapies is similar to the response of
patients without mutations.797,798
Patients with CDK12 mutations tend to have aggressive disease with high
rates of metastases and short OS. They also do not respond well to
hormonal therapy, PARP inhibitors, or taxanes. Two large, multiinstitutional, retrospective studies have shown that 11% to 33% of patients
with metastatic CRPC and CDK12 mutations responded to PD-1 inhibitors
(ie, nivolumab, pembrolizumab), some with durable responses.799,800 The
Panel awaits more data on the use of PD-1 inhibition in patients with
CDK12 mutations.
Olaparib

Preliminary clinical data using olaparib suggested favorable activity of this
agent in patients with HRR gene mutations, but not in those without HRR
mutations.786,787,801 The phase 3 PROfound study was a randomized trial
evaluating olaparib 300 mg twice daily versus physician’s choice of
abiraterone or enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC and progression on
at least one novel hormonal agent (abiraterone or enzalutamide) and up to
one prior taxane agent (permitted but not required).802 Patients had to have

a somatic or germline HRR gene mutation, and were allocated to one of
two cohorts: cohort A comprised patients with BRCA1/2 or ATM mutations,
and cohort B comprised patients with a mutation in at least one of 12 other
HRR genes (BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2,
PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L). The primary
endpoint of improving radiographic PFS with olaparib versus
abiraterone/enzalutamide was met in cohort A (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25–
0.47; P < .001), and radiographic PFS was also superior in the entire
study population encompassing cohorts A+B (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38–
0.63; P < .001).
In addition, final OS analysis of PROfound showed that OS was improved
with olaparib versus abiraterone/enzalutamide in cohort A (HR, 0.69; 95%
CI, 0.50–0.97; P = .02), despite the fact that 86 of 131 patients (66%)
crossed over to olaparib after disease progression in the control arm.803
The Panel notes that there may be heterogeneity of response to olaparib
based on which gene has a mutation. For example, patients with BRCA2
mutations experienced an OS benefit with olaparib (HR, 0.59; 95% CI,
0.37–0.95), whereas the HR for OS in patients with ATM mutations was
0.93 (95% CI, 0.53–1.75).803 Furthermore, there were few patients in
PROfound with mutations in some of the genes. For example, only 4
patients had BRIP1 mutations (2 in olaparib arm and 2 in control arm), 2
patients had RAD51D mutations (both in olaparib arm), and no patients
had RAD51C mutations.802
As a result of the favorable efficacy data from the PROfound trial, the FDA
approved olaparib (300 mg twice daily) in May 2020 for use in patients
with mCRPC and deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic
HRR gene mutations in at least one of 14 genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM,
BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B,
RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L) and who had previously received

Prostate Cancer
treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone.804 PPP2R2A was excluded
due to preliminary evidence of inferior activity of olaparib in this subset.
Since prior taxane therapy was not mandated in the PROfound study,
olaparib use might be reasonable in mCRPC patients both before or after
docetaxel treatment. Adverse events that may occur with olaparib
treatment include anemia (including that requiring transfusion), fatigue,
nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia,
creatinine elevation, cough, and dyspnea. Rare but serious side effects
may include thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli), druginduced pneumonitis, and a theoretical risk of myelodysplasia or acute
myeloid leukemia.802
The Panel recommends olaparib as an option for patients with metastatic
CRPC, previous androgen receptor-directed therapy, and an HRRm
regardless of prior docetaxel therapy (category 1). The HRR genes to be
considered for use of olaparib are BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1,
CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D
and RAD54L. Patients with PPP2R2A mutations in the PROfound trial
experienced an unfavorable risk-benefit profile; therefore, olaparib is not
recommended in patients with PPP2R2A mutations.
Any commercially available analytically and clinically validated somatic
tumor and ctDNA assays and germline assays can be used to identify
patients for treatment. Careful monitoring of complete blood counts and
hepatic and renal function, along with type and screens and potential
transfusion support and/or dose reductions as needed for severe anemia
or intolerance are recommended during olaparib therapy.
Rucaparib

Rucaparib is a second PARP inhibitor approved for use in patients with
mCRPC.790 This agent received accelerated FDA approval in May 2020
based on the preliminary favorable data from the TRITON2 clinical trial. In

that open-label single-arm phase 2 trial, patients with mCRPC harboring a
deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutation, who had previously received therapy with a novel
hormonal agent plus one taxane chemotherapy, were treated with
rucaparib 600 mg twice daily.805 The primary endpoint of TRITON2 was the
objective response rate in patients with measurable disease, and was
43.5% (95% CI, 31.0%–56.7%) in this BRCA1/2-mutated population.
Median radiographic PFS, a key secondary endpoint, was 9.0 months
(95% CI, 8.3–13.5 months).805 The FDA indication for rucaparib (600 mg
twice daily) is for use in patients with mCRPC and deleterious or
suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations,
and who had previously received treatment with both a novel hormonal
agent (enzalutamide or abiraterone) as well as one taxane-containing
chemotherapy. Based on this information, the Panel does not generally
recommend the use of rucaparib in BRCA1/2-mutated mCRPC patients
who have not previously received a taxane agent unless the patient is not
fit for chemotherapy. Furthermore, rucaparib should not be used in
patients with HRR gene mutations other than BRCA1/2.806 Adverse events
that may occur with rucaparib include anemia (including that requiring
transfusion), fatigue, asthenia, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss,
diarrhea or constipation, thrombocytopenia, increased creatinine,
increased liver transaminases, and rash. Rare but serious side effects of
rucaparib include a theoretical risk of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid
leukemia, as well as fetal teratogenicity.805,806 Full FDA approval of
rucaparib is contingent upon a favorable efficacy and safety profile of this
drug in the phase 3 TRITON3 study (NCT02975934), a randomized trial of
rucaparib versus physician’s choice of therapy (abiraterone, enzalutamide,
or docetaxel) in patients with mCRPC and a germline or somatic BRCA1/2
or ATM mutation who have previously received a novel hormonal agent
but no chemotherapy for mCRPC. The results of this trial are awaited.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
The Panel recommends rucaparib as an option for patients with metastatic
CRPC, prior treatment with a novel hormone therapy, and a BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutation. If the patient is not fit for chemotherapy, rucaparib can
be considered even if taxane-based therapy has not been given.
The preferred method of selecting patients for rucaparib treatment is
somatic analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 using a circulating tumor DNA
sample. As with olaparib, careful monitoring of complete blood counts and
hepatic and renal function, along with type and screens and potential
transfusion support and/or dose reductions as needed for severe anemia
or intolerance are recommended during treatment with rucaparib.

Small Cell/Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer
De novo small cell carcinoma in untreated prostate cancers occurs rarely
and is very aggressive.807 Treatment-associated small cell/neuroendocrine
prostate cancer that occurs in patients with metastatic CRPC is more
common.808 In a multi-institution prospective series of 202 consecutive
patients with metastatic CRPC, all of whom underwent metastatic
biopsies, small cell/neuroendocrine histology was present in 17%.808
Patients with small cell/neuroendocrine tumors and prior abiraterone
and/or enzalutamide had a shorter OS when compared with those with
adenocarcinoma and prior abiraterone and/or enzalutamide (HR, 2.02;
95% CI, 1.07–3.82). Genomic analysis showed that DNA repair mutations
and small cell/neuroendocrine histology were almost mutually exclusive.
Small cell/neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate should be considered
in patients who no longer respond to ADT and test positive for metastases.
These relatively rare tumors are associated with low PSA levels despite
large metastatic burden and visceral disease.809 Those with initial Grade
Group 5 are especially at risk. Biopsy of accessible metastatic lesions
should be considered to identify patients with small cell/neuroendocrine
histomorphologic features in patients with visceral metastases.810

These cases may be managed by cytotoxic chemotherapy (ie,
cisplatin/etoposide, carboplatin/etoposide, docetaxel/carboplatin,
cabazitaxel/carboplatin).771,811,812 Physicians should consult the NCCN
Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer (available at www.NCCN.org),
because the behavior of small cell/neuroendocrine carcinoma of the
prostate is similar to that of small cell carcinoma of the lung.

Bone Metastases
In a multicenter study, 643 patients with CRPC and asymptomatic or
minimally symptomatic bone metastases were randomized to intravenous
zoledronic acid every 3 weeks or placebo.813 At 15 months, fewer patients
in the zoledronic acid 4-mg group than patients in the placebo group had
SREs (33% vs. 44%; P = .02). An update at 24 months also revealed an
increase in the median time to first SRE (488 days vs. 321 days; P =
.01).814 No significant differences were found in OS. Other
bisphosphonates have not been shown to be effective for prevention of
disease-related skeletal complications. Earlier use of zoledronic acid in
patients with castration-naïve prostate cancer and bone metastases is not
associated with lower risk for SREs, and in general should not be used for
SRE prevention until the development of metastatic CRPC.815
The randomized TRAPEZE trial used a 2 X 2 factorial design to compare
clinical PFS (pain progression, SREs, or death) as the primary outcome in
757 patients with bone metastatic CRPC treated with docetaxel alone or
with zoledronic acid, 89Sr, or both.816 The bone-directed therapies had no
statistically significant effect on the primary outcome or on OS in
unadjusted analysis. However, adjusted analysis revealed a small effect
for 89Sr on clinical PFS (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.99; P = .03). For
secondary outcomes, zoledronic acid improved the SRE-free interval (HR,
0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.95; P = .01) and decreased the total SREs (424 vs.
605) compared with docetaxel alone.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023
Prostate Cancer
Denosumab was compared to zoledronic acid in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study in patients with CRPC.817 The absolute
incidence of SREs was similar in the two groups; however, the median
time to first SRE was delayed by 3.6 months by denosumab compared to
zoledronic acid (20.7 vs. 17.1 months; P = .0002 for non-inferiority, P =
.008 for superiority). The rates of important SREs with denosumab were
similar to zoledronic acid and included spinal cord compression (3% vs.
4%), need for radiation (19% vs. 21%), and pathologic fracture (14% vs.
15%).
Treatment-related toxicities reported for zoledronic acid and denosumab
were similar and included hypocalcemia (more common with denosumab
13% vs. 6%), arthralgias, and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ, 1%–2%
incidence). Most, but not all, patients who develop ONJ have preexisting
dental problems.818
Therefore, denosumab every 4 weeks (category 1) or zoledronic acid
every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended for patients with CRPC and bone
metastases to prevent or delay disease-associated SREs. SREs include
pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, operation, or EBRT to
bone. The optimal duration of zoledronic acid or denosumab in patients
with CRPC and bone metastases remains unclear. A multi-institutional,
open-label, randomized trial in 1822 patients with bone-metastatic prostate
cancer, breast cancer, or multiple myeloma found that zoledronic acid
every 12 weeks was non-inferior to zoledronic acid every 4 weeks.819 In
the every-12-weeks and every-4-weeks arms, 28.6% and 29.5%
experienced at least 1 SRE within 2 years of randomization, respectively.
Oral hygiene, baseline dental evaluation for high-risk individuals, and
avoidance of invasive dental surgery during therapy are recommended to
reduce the risk of ONJ.820 If invasive dental surgery is necessary, therapy
should be deferred until the dentist confirms that the patient has healed
completely from the dental procedure. Supplemental calcium and vitamin

D are recommended to prevent hypocalcemia in patients receiving either
denosumab or zoledronic acid.
Monitoring of creatinine clearance is required to guide dosing of zoledronic
acid. Zoledronic acid should be dose reduced in patients with impaired
renal function (estimated creatinine clearance 30–60 mL/min), and held for
creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.821 Denosumab may be administered to
patients with impaired renal function or even patients on hemodialysis;
however, the risk for severe hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia is
greater, and the dose, schedule, and safety of denosumab have not yet
been defined. A single study of 55 patients with creatinine clearance <30
mL/min or on hemodialysis evaluated the use of 60-mg-dose
denosumab.822 Hypocalcemia should be corrected before starting
denosumab, and serum calcium monitoring is required for denosumab and
recommended for zoledronic acid, with repletion as needed.
Radium-223 is a category 1 option to treat symptomatic bone metastases
without visceral metastases, and the use of palliative, systemic radiation
with either 89Sr or 153Sm (see Radium-223 and Other
Radiopharmaceuticals, above).
Clinical research continues on the prevention or delay of disease spread
to bone. A phase 3 randomized trial of 1432 patients with non-metastatic
CRPC at high risk of bone involvement showed that denosumab delayed
bone metastasis by 4 months compared to placebo.823 OS was not
improved, and the FDA did not approve this indication for denosumab.

Visceral Metastases

The panel defines visceral metastases as those occurring in the liver, lung,
adrenal gland, peritoneum, or brain. Soft tissue/lymph node sites are not
considered visceral metastases. In general, there are less data on
treatment of patients with CRPC and visceral metastases than for those
without visceral metastases. This is especially true in patients who have

Prostate Cancer
already received docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy, where all
systemic therapies are given a category 2B recommendation.

Sequencing of Therapy in CRPC
No chemotherapy regimen has demonstrated improved survival or QOL
after cabazitaxel, although several systemic agents other than
mitoxantrone have shown palliative and radiographic response benefits in
clinical trials (ie, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vinorelbine,
carboplatin/etoposide, docetaxel/carboplatin, gemcitabine/oxaliplatin,
paclitaxel/carboplatin824-833). Prednisone or dexamethasone at low doses
may provide palliative benefits in the chemotherapy-refractory setting.834
No survival benefit for combination regimens over sequential single-agent
regimens has been demonstrated, and toxicity is higher with combination
regimens. Treatment with these agents could be considered after an
informed discussion between the physician and an individual patient about
treatment goals and risks/side effects and alternatives, which must include
best supportive care. Participation in a clinical trial is encouraged.
No randomized trials that compare taxane chemotherapies versus novel
hormonal therapies in patients who previously had abiraterone or
enzalutamide have been reported, and some data suggest crossresistance between abiraterone and enzalutamide.835-838 One molecular
biomarker that may aid appropriate selection of therapy after progression
on abiraterone or enzalutamide is the presence of AR-V7 in CTCs (See
AR-V7 Testing, below).839 Results of a randomized, open-label, phase 2,
crossover trial suggest that the sequence of abiraterone followed by
enzalutamide is more efficacious than the reverse.840
AR-V7 Testing
Cross resistance between novel androgen receptor pathway inhibitors is
common with sequential therapy. This lack of response of patients with
metastatic CRPC to abiraterone and enzalutamide, particularly after

disease progression on enzalutamide or abiraterone, is associated with
detection of AR-V7 mRNA in CTCs using an RNA-based polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) assay.841 AR-V7 presence did not preclude clinical
benefit from taxane chemotherapies (docetaxel and cabazitaxel).842 While
other mechanisms of cross-resistance clearly exist, patients with AR-V7–
positive CTCs exhibited superior PFS with taxanes compared to novel
hormonal therapies (abiraterone and enzalutamide); the two classes of
agents resulted in comparable PFS in patients with AR-V7–negative
CTCs. A confirmatory study used a different CTC assay that detected
nuclear-localized AR-V7 protein using immunofluorescence. Patients with
AR-V7–positive CTCs had superior OS with taxanes versus abiraterone or
enzalutamide, whereas OS was not different between the two classes of
agents among patients with AR-V7–negative CTCs.843
A blinded, correlative study at three cancer centers assessed the
correlation between AR-V7 results before second-line treatment and OS in
patients with metastatic CRPC.844 Approximately half of the validation
cohort received taxane therapy in first line, whereas half received an
androgen receptor signaling inhibitor. In a high-risk subset of this cohort,
patients negative for AR-V7 had superior OS if they were treated with an
androgen receptor signaling inhibitor than if they were treated with a
taxane (median OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months; HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.00–2.81;
P = .05).
PROPHECY was a prospective multicenter validation study, which
enrolled 118 patients with metastatic CRPC who were starting abiraterone
or enzalutamide.845 The primary endpoint was to validate the prognostic
significance of baseline AR-V7 in CTCs on radiographic or clinical PFS.
Secondary endpoints included OS. Prior exposure to enzalutamide or
abiraterone was permitted if the alternative hormonal therapy was
planned. After adjusting for CTC number and clinical prognostic factors,
the detection of AR-V7 was associated with a shorter PFS (HR, 1.9 [P =

.032] or 2.4 [P = .020], depending on the test used) and OS (HR, 4.2 [95%
CI, 2.1–8.5] or 3.5 [95% CI, 1.6–8.1], depending on the test used)
regardless of first- or second-line AR inhibitor use. In the updated final
analyses, CTC AR-V7 was confirmed to be independently a poor
prognostic factor for AR therapy, but was not significantly predictive of the
benefits of docetaxel nor cabazitaxel, where outcomes were similar
regardless of AR-V7 status.846
These clinical experiences suggest that AR-V7 assays may be a useful
predictor of abiraterone and enzalutamide resistance in patients with
metastatic CRPC particularly following progression on prior enzalutamide
or abiraterone. The prevalence of AR-V7 positivity is only 3% in patients
prior to treatment with enzalutamide, abiraterone, and taxanes,843 so the
Panel believes AR-V7 detection would not be useful to inform treatment
decisions before these treatments are given. On the other hand, the
prevalence of AR-V7 positivity is higher after progression on abiraterone
or enzalutamide (19%–39%841), but data have already shown that
abiraterone/enzalutamide crossover therapy is rarely effective long-term,
and taxanes are more effective in this setting. The Panel recommends that
use of AR-V7 tests can be considered to help guide selection of therapy in
the post-abiraterone/enzalutamide metastatic CRPC setting.

Summary
The intention of these guidelines is to provide a framework on which to
base treatment decisions. Prostate cancer is a complex disease, with
many controversial aspects of management and with a dearth of sound
data to support many treatment recommendations. Several variables
(including adjusted life expectancy, disease characteristics, predicted
outcomes, and patient preferences) must be considered by the patient and
physician to tailor prostate cancer therapy for the individual patient.

* Interpret with caution. Wherever possible, studies were included that used histopathologic confirmation, but not all studies used confirmatory
histology as gold standard. Values may vary depending upon the site of the lesion and phase of the disease process.
** CLR: Correct localization rate. Patient-level positive predictive value + anatomic lesion co-localization. Preferred over sensitivity and specificity in
analyses of patients with BCR.
