SCREENING AND EARLY DETECTION
Subclinical prostate cancer is common in men >50 years.
Population-based screening of men aged between 55 and
69 years, using prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) testing, has
been evaluated.1 After a median follow-up of 16 years, the
European screening trial demonstrated a 25% relative
reduction in prostate cancer mortality. However, 570 men
needed to be invited for screening and 18 patients needed
to be treated to prevent one death from prostate cancer,
and there was no effect on overall survival (OS).
Risk-adapted early detection of prostate cancer using a
baseline PSA has been evaluated in retrospective cohort
studies. Men with a PSA >1 ng/ml at 40 years or >2 ng/ml
at 60 years are at increased risk of prostate cancer metastasis or death from prostate cancer.2
Recommendations
 Population-based PSA screening of men for prostate cancer
reduces prostate cancer mortality at the expense of overdiagnosis and overtreatment and is not recommended [I, C].
 Early PSA testing (baseline PSA followed by risk-adapted
follow-up) can be offered to men >50 years, men >45
years with a family history of prostate cancer, AfricanAmericans >45 years and BRCA1/2 carriers >40 years
[III, B].

 Testing for prostate cancer in asymptomatic men
should not be done in men with a life expectancy <10
years [I, E].
DIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY
The risk of clinically signiﬁcant prostate cancer is related to age,
ethnicity, family history, PSA level, free/total PSA ratio and
ﬁndings on digital rectal examination.3 Physicians are encouraged to use risk calculators incorporating these factors.4 Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is recommended before prostate biopsy.5e7 Targeted transperineal
biopsies, in comparison with systematic transrectal biopsies,
result in an increased detection rate of clinically signiﬁcant
prostate cancer, a decreased detection rate of clinically insigniﬁcant prostate cancer and fewer adverse events.5 When
mpMRI is positive [i.e. Prostate ImagingeReporting and Data
System (PI-RADS) 3], targeted  systematic biopsy should be
done. When mpMRI is negative (i.e. PI-RADS 2), and clinical
suspicion of prostate cancer is low, the biopsy can be omitted.
Diagnostic work-up is shown in Figure 1.
Recommendations
 mpMRI should be carried out before prostate biopsy
[I, B].
 A prostate cancer risk calculator and/or mpMRI should
be used to conﬁrm the indication for biopsy in men
with elevated PSA [III, C].
 Transperineal biopsies are recommended, rather than
transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies [III, B].
 Each biopsy should be reported individually and evaluated using the International Society of Urological Pathology Consensus recommendations [II, B].8

In addition to PSA level and MRI results, the decision to biopsy or not should be made in light of DRE ﬁndings, ethnicity, age, comorbidities, free/total PSA, history of
previous biopsy and patient values.

STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT
Staging and risk assessment are presented in supplementary
Tables S1 and S2, available at Annals of Oncology online.
Patients who are not suitable for treatment with curative
intent, by virtue of poor general health, do not normally
require staging investigations. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) provides T staging9 and can inform surgical technique
1120

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.06.011

with respect to nerve-sparing and wide excision of areas of
potential extra-prostatic extension. Men with low-risk disease [T1/2, Gleason score (GS) 6, PSA 10]10 do not
require further imaging. Within the low-risk category, percentage of positive cores, length of core involvement, PSA
density and a lower free/total PSA ratio are positively
associated with risk of understaging.

Men with intermediate- or high-risk disease10 should
have imaging for nodal or metastatic disease. Whole-body
MRI, choline-positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT)11 and prostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET-CT12,13 have better sensitivity and
speciﬁcity than CT or bone scan but have not been shown to
improve clinical outcomes. The evidence regarding PET and
whole-body MRI in this setting is not adequate to make a
recommendation concerning their use. Patients with localised disease on routine imaging should not be denied
radical local treatment solely because metastatic lesions are
identiﬁed on novel imaging techniques.

Recommendations
 Localised disease should be classiﬁed as low-, intermediate- or high-risk as a guide to prognosis and therapy [III,
A].
 Patients with intermediate-risk disease should be staged
for metastases using MRI or CT (abdomen and pelvis)
and bone scan [III, B].
 Patients with high-risk disease should be staged for metastases using CT (chest, abdomen and pelvis) and bone
scan [III, B].

MANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE
There is no consensus regarding optimum management of
localised disease (Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3). Patients
should be informed of the beneﬁts and harms of the
different options. Given the range of treatment options and
their side-effects, men should be offered the opportunity to
consult with both a urologist and a radiation oncologist.
Men should be counselled that treatment of prostate cancer may cause sexual dysfunction, infertility, bowel and
urinary problems.
Watchful waiting with delayed hormone therapy for
symptomatic progression is an option for men who are not
suitable for, or unwilling to have, treatment with curative
intent. Active surveillance is a strategy of close monitoring,
typically using PSA, repeat biopsies and MRI, keeping
curative treatment for those with evidence of disease progression. There is no good evidence comparing different
methods of active surveillance.14
Curative options include radical prostatectomy (RP),
external beam radiotherapy (RT) and low-dose-rate
brachytherapy. Two randomised, controlled trials (RCTs)
have compared RP and watchful waiting.15,16 The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (SPCG) Study 4 accrued 695
men during the 1990s, at a time when PSA testing was not
routinely carried out, and may not be applicable to screendetected cancers. After a mean follow-up of 29 years, the
risk of death from prostate cancer was 20.4% and 31.6% in
the RP and the watchful waiting groups, respectively. RP
increased the rate of erectile dysfunction (80% versus 45%),
and urinary leakage (49% versus 21%),15 but these rates
may not be generalisable to high-volume surgical centres.

The PIVOT trial recruited 731 North American men between 1994 and 2002.16 They were more representative of
men with PSA-detected cancer, but had a remarkably high
rate of comorbidity. No signiﬁcant difference was seen in OS
between RP and watchful waiting [hazard ratio (HR) 0.88;
95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.71e1.08]. In the low-risk
subgroup of 296 men, the risk of death from prostate
cancer was <3% at 12 years, with no signiﬁcant beneﬁt for
surgery. Indeed, the trend both in terms of prostate cancerspeciﬁc mortality (HR 1.48; 95% CI 0.42e0.54) and overall
mortality (HR 1.15; 95% CI 0.80e1.66), favoured watchful
waiting rather than surgery. However, the high overall
mortality rate of w50% at 10 years illustrates the recruitment of men with signiﬁcant comorbidities.
ProtecT is a prospective randomised clinical phase III trial
comparing active therapy (RP or RT) versus active monitoring (repeat biopsy in men with a PSA rise of >50% from
the baseline value).17 The trial recruited 1643 men with
localised prostate cancer; after a median follow-up of 10
years there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in
terms of cancer-speciﬁc survival, which was 99% in all three
arms. However, there was a statistically signiﬁcant increase
in the frequency of skeletal metastases and the need for
androgen deprivation in the active monitoring arm.

The case for adding radical local treatment for men with
high-risk localised and locally advanced disease is based on
two RCTs. The SPCG-7 trial included 875 men who received
3 months of combined androgen blockade (CAB) followed
by ﬂutamide monotherapy.18 They were randomised
whether to receive radical RT to the prostate. It showed a
beneﬁcial impact of radical RT in terms of cause-speciﬁc
(11.9% versus 23.9%, P < 0.001), and overall mortality
(29.6% versus 39.4%, P ¼ 0.004). The National Cancer
Institute of Canada/Medical Research Council (NCIC/MRC)
trial randomised high-risk patients to either lifelong
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone or to ADT plus
RT. The addition of RT improved the 7-year survival from
66% to 74% (P ¼ 0.003).19
For patients receiving radical prostate RT, dose escalation
using intensity-modulated RT or image-guided RT improves
biochemical control with acceptable toxicity.20 Moderate

hypofractionation is non-inferior in terms of biochemical
control, is more convenient and has acceptable toxicity.21
Patients treated with RP for high-risk disease often
require postoperative RT  ADT.
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant hormone treatment
The value of neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT, with RT, in men
with high-risk localised and locally advanced disease, has been
established by multiple randomised trials. For example, in the
Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) 96-01 trial,
818 men with locally advanced prostate cancer were
randomly assigned to RT alone, RT plus 3 months’ neoadjuvant and concurrent CAB or RT plus 6 months’ CAB.22
Compared with RT alone, the use of 6 months’ hormone
therapy signiﬁcantly improved overall mortality (HR 0.63; 95%
CI 0.48e0.83). Similarly, the Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG) trial 8610, in 456 men with T2-4 disease, found
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.06.011

1123

C. Parker et al.

Annals of Oncology
an improvement in 10-year prostate cancer-speciﬁc mortality
(23% versus 36%; P ¼ 0.01) for the addition of 4 months’
neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT.23
Intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer has been
subdivided into favourable and unfavourable categories.24
Unfavourable intermediate-risk disease was deﬁned as any
of primary Gleason pattern 4, percentage of positive biopsy
cores 50% or 2 intermediate-risk factors (cT2b-c, GS 7,
PSA 10e20). Patients with unfavourable intermediate-risk
disease have a worse outcome than those with favourable
intermediate-risk disease, and might be more likely to
beneﬁt from neoadjuvant ADT.
Adjuvant ADT, after RT, has been studied in multiple RCTs.
The RTOG 92-02 trial randomised 1554 patients to receive
either 4 months or 28 months of ADT in addition to RT.25 In
an unplanned subgroup analysis, the addition of adjuvant
ADT improved OS in those with a GS of 8e10 (81.0% versus
70.7%, P ¼ 0.044). The European Organisation for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22961 trial randomised
970 men with locally advanced disease to receive either 6
months or 36 months of ADT in addition to radical RT.26 The
5-year overall mortality for short-term and long-term suppression was 19.0% and 15.2%, respectively (HR 1.42; CI
1.09e1.85).
A recent RCT evaluated 18 versus 36 months’ adjuvant
ADT in 630 men with high-risk prostate cancer.27 After a
median follow-up of 9.4 years, the 5-year OS was 91% for
the 36-months arm and 86% for the 18-months arm (P ¼
0.07). While this was a relatively small trial, with a more
favourable case mix than EORTC 22961, given the additional
toxicity of longer-term ADT, 18 months of treatment may be
preferred by some patients.
No large RCTs are available for adjuvant treatment
following RP for lymph node-positive disease. Based on the
data of a large retrospective series including 2596 patients
with pN1 disease, combined adjuvant RT and 2 years of ADT
results in an improved 8-year cancer-speciﬁc mortality rate
for men with two positive lymph nodes associated with
pT3b/pT4 and/or positive surgical margins as compared
with RT alone.28 However, the option of PSA-triggered
follow-up and initiation of ADT at time of PSA rise was
not included.
Neoadjuvant docetaxel for M0 disease
Six RCTs have tested early docetaxel-based chemotherapy
(ChT) in high-risk localised disease. GETUG-12 compared
standard of care (ADT for 3 years plus RT) with or without 4
cycles of docetaxel-estramustine. The primary end point of
relapse-free survival (RFS) was improved (HR 0.71; 95% CI
0.54e0.94, P ¼ 0.017).29 A recent update with a median
follow-up of 12 years showed that clinical RFS (cRFS;
deﬁned as metastases, local relapse or death) was also
improved with docetaxel (median cRFS 13.9 years versus
12.5 years; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.56e1.00; P ¼ 0.0491).30 RTOG
0521 tested RT plus 2 years ADT with or without 6 cycles of
docetaxel and reported a borderline improved RFS [HR 0.76;
(95% CI 0.57e1.00); P ¼ 0.05]. OS did not reach signiﬁcance
1124

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.06.011

by standard two-sided P value (one-sided P ¼ 0.03; HR 0.68;
95% CI 0.44e1.03).31 A subset of men randomised in the
STAMPEDE trial had high-risk localised disease (and/or
pelvic enlarged lymph nodes) and RFS was improved in men
randomised to receive docetaxel (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.45e
0.80; P ¼ 0.283  103).32 A meta-analysis of these three
trials supported RFS improvement with docetaxel in men
with high-risk localised disease (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.61e0.81;
P < 0.0001) but OS data were immature.33
Since then, three other trials [SPCG-12, SPCG-13 and VA
Cooperative Study Program (CSP) #553] have reported preliminary data in congresses with no signiﬁcant RFS
beneﬁt.34e36 SPCG-13 may have included patients at insufﬁcient risk of relapse to derive any beneﬁt.34 SPCG-12 did not
use ADT as part of the standard of care,35 and VA CSP #553
had limited power (only 297 patients participated), although
a trend favouring docetaxel was observed.36
In men with high-risk localised prostate cancer, very longterm follow-up is needed to show survival differences:
assuming cooperative groups are able to collect long-term
data, this should be achieved around 2020e2025 for
these trials. Based on the available data, offering docetaxelbased ChT may be a reasonable option for younger, ﬁt men
with multiple risk factors for recurrence.
Postoperative RT
Postoperative RT following RP may be given as adjuvant RT
(ART; undetectable postoperative PSA) or salvage RT (SRT;
persistent or rising PSA). Three RCTs investigated ART
compared with observation (EORTC 22911, SWOG 8794 and
ARO 96-02).37 All showed improved biochemical control for
ART, but no consistent OS beneﬁt was seen. More recent
trials, RADICALS-RT, RAVES and GETUG-17, have compared
ART with a policy of observation with early SRT given at the
time of PSA failure. All three trials have been combined in
the ARTISTIC meta-analysis that was presented at ESMO
2019. The results show that ART has some harms (increased
bladder and bowel morbidity), but no proven beneﬁt in
terms of biochemical progression-free survival (PFS). Thus,
observation with SRT in the event of PSA failure is the
current standard after RP. SRT should be given early. Outcomes are more favourable if SRT is used when PSA is <0.5
ng/ml.38
Three trials have compared SRT versus SRT plus 6 months
of ADT (GETUG-AFU 16, RTOG 0534) or plus 24 months of
bicalutamide (RTOG 9601).39 RTOG 9601 showed a reduced
rate of prostate cancer death (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.59e0.99;
P ¼ 0.04) and improved OS (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32e0.74;
P < 0.001).39 Post hoc subgroup analysis indicated that men
with a pre-SRT PSA above 0.7 ng/ml, GS 8-10 and positive
margins had the largest beneﬁt from the addition of
bicalutamide.39 The GETUG-AFU 16 trial showed an
improvement in metastasis-free survival (HR 0.73; 95% CI
0.54e0.98; P ¼ 0.034),40 but not OS.
The SPPORT-trial, presented at the 2018 American Society for Radiation Oncology annual meeting,41 investigated
the potential of pelvic nodal RT with 6 months of ADT as

compared with prostate bed-only RT or prostate bed RT plus
6 months of ADT. The addition of pelvic RT improved
freedom from failure, as well as an improvement in
freedom from metastases for the comparison with prostate
bed-only RT (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.30e0.92; P ¼ 0.014). There
were no OS differences observed between arms.

Intermittent versus continuous ADT was studied in a
randomised trial of 1386 patients with a PSA at relapse of
>3.0 ng/ml >1 year after radical RT. Intermittent ADT had a
more favourable toxicity proﬁle with no difference in OS
(HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.86e1.21).51
Recommendations

Treatment of relapse after radical local treatment
Re-staging. For patients with biochemically recurrent
prostate cancer, PSMA-PET imaging is replacing conventional imaging, based on its superior sensitivity and speciﬁcity.42 Nevertheless, there are no trials indicating that the
earlier detection of recurrence and subsequent change in
management improves outcomes. The study of modern
imaging methods has focused on their diagnostic performance, not their effect on care pathways.42
Local salvage therapy. The natural history of PSA recurrence
following primary treatment43 is long, and life expectancy
should be taken into account when considering local
treatment options. Molecular imaging studies have indicated that up to 50% of men experience a local recurrence
in case of a PSA rise.42 mpMRI is useful in the detection of
local recurrence and can guide targeted biopsies. In case
of a biopsy-conﬁrmed local recurrence and the absence of
metastases, several local treatment options are available,
such as salvage RP, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryoablation or brachytherapy. Taken together, these treatments typically give only temporary biochemical control in
most patients with important morbidity.44 None of these
options have been compared head-to-head.
Metastasis-directed therapy. Earlier visualisation of recurrence makes it technically possible to selectively ablate
metastases. Hypothetically, this would slow down progression and improve survival.45 Most evidence in this setting
comes from retrospective case series.46 More recently, two
randomised phase II trials have been published.47,48 The
STOMP trial showed an improved biochemical progression
and time to palliative ADT with metastasis-directed therapy
compared with observation and deferred ADT.48 In the
SABR-COMET trial, different solid tumour types were
included, of which 16% were prostate cancer. This trial
showed improved OS for additional stereotactic body RT
(SBRT) to standard of care.48 Both trials have paved the way
for larger conﬁrmatory phase III trials, but should not be
considered as conclusive evidence to offer metastasisdirected therapy.
Systemic therapy. Two randomised trials, TOAD and ELAAT,
have compared early versus deferred ADT for men with a
PSA failure after local therapy.49 The reasons to start ADT
were development of symptoms or metastases on conventional imaging or PSA doubling time decreasing to 6
months. Pooled analysis found no survival beneﬁt with early
ADT (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.40e1.41; P ¼ 0.37).50 Early ADT had
an adverse effect on quality of life (QoL), speciﬁcally in
terms of sexual activity and hot ﬂushes.49

 Watchful waiting with delayed ADT for symptomatic
progression is an option for men who are not suitable
for, or unwilling to have, radical treatment [I, A].
 Active surveillance is recommended for men with
low-risk disease [II, A].
 RP or RT (external beam or brachytherapy) is an option
for men with low-risk disease not suitable for active surveillance [III, B].
 RP or RT (external beam or brachytherapy) is recommended for men with intermediate-risk disease [I, B].
 Primary ADT alone is not recommended as standard
initial treatment for non-metastatic disease [I, D].
 External beam RT plus ADT is recommended for men
with high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer [I, B].
 RP plus pelvic lymphadenectomy is an option for
selected men with high-risk disease [III, B].
 Men receiving radical RT for intermediate-risk disease
should have short-course ADT for 4e6 months [I, A].
 Men receiving radical RT for high-risk disease should
have long-course ADT (18e36 months) [I, A].
 Neoadjuvant docetaxel ChT may be offered before RT for
young, ﬁt men with very high-risk localised prostate cancer [I, C].
 Following RP, patients should have their serum PSA level
monitored, with salvage RT recommended in the event
of PSA failure [III, B].
 Adjuvant postoperative RT after RP is not routinely recommended [I, B].
 Salvage RT should start early (e.g. PSA <0.5 ng/ml) [III,
B]. Concomitant ADT for 6 months or bicalutamide 150
mg daily for 2 years may be offered to men having
salvage RT [I, B].
 Men having SRT to the prostate bed may be offered pelvic nodal RT [I, C].
 Men with biochemical relapse after radical RT who may
be candidates for local salvage or metastasis-directed
treatment should undergo imaging with PET-CT [III, B].
 Early ADT alone is not recommended for men with
biochemical relapse unless they have a rapid PSA
doubling time, symptomatic local disease or proven metastases [II, D].
 Men starting ADT for biochemical relapse, in the absence
of metastatic disease, should be offered intermittent
rather than continuous treatment [I, B].

ADT improves OS in mHNPC. Most of the relevant trials,
discussed below, largely included men with de novo metastatic disease, and caution should be used when extrapolating the results to men who relapsed with metastases
after previous local treatment.
The beneﬁt of docetaxel for mHNPC was established by
two phase III trials, CHAARTED52 and STAMPEDE.32 The
CHAARTED study randomised 790 patients to receive ADT
alone or in combination with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 21
days for 6 cycles. Docetaxel improved OS (HR 0.72; 95% CI
0.59e0.89). The STAMPEDE study is a multi-arm, multistage phase III study designed to test whether the addition
of various treatments to ADT improves OS. It includes patients with both M0 and M1 disease. Patients were randomised to ADT alone (n ¼ 1184) or in combination with
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 21 days with prednisone 10 mg
daily for 6 cycles (n ¼ 592). The addition of docetaxel in M1
patients signiﬁcantly improved OS compared with ADT
alone (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62e0.92). The OS beneﬁt for
docetaxel was similar when combined with zoledronic acid
(HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66e0.96). A third study, GETUG-AFU
1553 randomised 385 mHNPC patients to receive ADT or
ADT plus docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 21 days for 9 cycles.
Patients in the ChT arm had improved PSA PFS and radiographic PFS (rPFS), but these did not translate into a beneﬁt
in OS (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.75e1.36). Subgroup analysis of the
CHAARTED study showed more pronounced beneﬁt in patients with high-volume disease (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50e
0.79),54 deﬁned as the presence of four or more bone
metastases with one or more beyond vertebral bodies and

pelvis, visceral metastasis or both. However, meta-analysis
of CHAARTED, STAMPEDE and GETUG-AFU 15 have
conﬁrmed the improvement in OS with the addition of
docetaxel to ADT regardless of disease volume (HR 0.77;
95% CI 0.68e0.87).33,55
The addition of abiraterone to ADT has demonstrated
improved OS compared with ADT alone in two phase III
trials, LATITUDE56 and STAMPEDE.57 Both studies randomised participants to ADT alone or in combination with
abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5 mg daily until disease progression. LATITUDE randomised 1199 patients with
high-risk metastatic prostate cancer, deﬁned as the presence of at least two of the following: GS 8, three or more
bone metastases or visceral metastases. The addition of
abiraterone to ADT resulted in a signiﬁcant improvement in
OS (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.51e0.76).56 Updated data after
crossover and 2-year additional follow-up conﬁrmed this
(HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.56e0.78).58 A similar beneﬁt in survival
was observed in the STAMPEDE trial for the M1 subgroup
(HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.52e0.76).57 LATITUDE enrolled only
patients with de novo metastatic prostate cancer, and only
5% of patients included in STAMPEDE were relapsing M1.
Therefore, the beneﬁt of adding abiraterone to ADT in the
latter group of patients is uncertain.
The phase III trial TITAN demonstrated that addition of
apalutamide to ADT improves OS in mHNPC.59 The study
randomised 1052 participants to ADT alone or in combination with apalutamide 240 mg per day. A total of 16% of
patients had received treatment of localised disease and
were enrolled at M1 relapse. Only 11% of patients had

received early docetaxel. Most patients had high-volume
disease (63%). The addition of apalutamide improved OS
(HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.51e0.89; P ¼ 0.005) with no signiﬁcant
differences according to disease volume. Given the limited
number of patients that received apalutamide after docetaxel, the beneﬁt of this strategy remains unclear.
The beneﬁt of adding enzalutamide to ADT for the
treatment of mHNPC patients has been established by two
phase III studies, ARCHES60 and ENZAMET.61 ARCHES
randomised 1150 mHNPC patients to ADT plus enzalutamide 160 mg daily or ADT plus placebo. Participants were
stratiﬁed by disease volume and prior docetaxel therapy. At
the interim analysis, the primary end point was met, as
enzalutamide signiﬁcantly improved rPFS (HR 0.39; 95% CI
0.30e0.50; P < 0.001). The rPFS beneﬁt was consistent
across all prespeciﬁed subgroups, including disease volume
and prior docetaxel ChT. At the time of this interim analysis, data on OS were immature. The second phase III study,
ENZAMET,61 randomised 1125 men with mHNPC to either
ADT plus other non-steroidal anti-androgens, including
bicalutamide, nilutamide or ﬂutamide, versus ADT plus
enzalutamide. Enzalutamide resulted in a signiﬁcant
improvement in OS (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.52e0.86). This is the
ﬁrst study to examine the use of an androgen receptor (AR)
signalling inhibitor with or without concurrent docetaxel;
45% of patients were planned to receive docetaxel.
The HR for OS was 0.53 (95% CI 0.37e0.75) for those who
were not planned to receive docetaxel, and 0.90 (95% CI
0.62e1.31) for those who were planned to receive
docetaxel.
Docetaxel plus ADT and abiraterone plus ADT have been
compared in an opportunistic randomised analysis from the
STAMPEDE trial, suggesting similar outcomes in the M1
subgroup.62 On the other hand, indirect Bayesian comparisons have suggested that the survival and QoL beneﬁt
provided by abiraterone may be greater than that seen with
docetaxel.63 Since no biomarkers have been identiﬁed to
select one therapy over another, the decision to use abiraterone, apalutamide, enzalutamide or docetaxel should be
individualised taking into consideration the cost, access to
treatment, toxicity proﬁles, duration of treatment, comorbidities and patient preferences.
Two randomised trials, HORRAD64 and STAMPEDE,65 have
compared lifelong ADT alone or in combination with RT to
the primary tumour for mHNPC. The HORRAD trial randomised 446 patients to receive ADT alone or in combination
with RT to the primary (70 Gy in 35 fractions for 7 weeks or
57.76 Gy in 19 fractions for 6 weeks). RT improved time to
PSA progression (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63e0.97), but not OS
(HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.70e1.14).64 The STAMPEDE trial allowed
docetaxel in both arms in addition to ADT. RT to the primary
was then commenced within 3e4 weeks after the last
docetaxel dose (55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 36 Gy
in six fractions over 6 weeks). RT improved failure-free
survival (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.68e0.84; P < 0.0001) but not
OS (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.80e1.06). The prespeciﬁed lowvolume subgroup, deﬁned according to the CHAARTED
criteria, had a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in both failure-free survival

(HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.49e0.72) and OS (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.52e
0.90).
Management of bone health and prevention of cancer
treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL) is an important part of
the treatment of men with prostate cancer under hormonal
treatment. Prevention of CTIBL is covered by separate
ESMO guidelines.66
Recommendations
 ADT is recommended as ﬁrst-line treatment of mHNPC in
combination with abiraterone/prednisone [ESMOMagnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale (ESMO-MCBS) v1.1
score: 4] or apalutamide [ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] or
docetaxel [ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] or enzalutamide
[ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] [I, A].
 RT to the primary tumour combined with the systemic
treatment is recommended for patients with lowvolume mHNPC [I, A].
 ADT alone is recommended as ﬁrst-line systemic treatment of mHNPC in men who are unﬁt for abiraterone,
apalutamide, enzalutamide and docetaxel [III, A].
 For men starting on ADT, management to prevent CTIBL
is recommended.66

NON-METASTATIC CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE
CANCER
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is deﬁned as
disease progression during ADT, with serum testosterone at
castrate levels.67 The absence of metastases (M0) on
traditional imaging (bone scintigraphy and CT scan) has
been used to identify M0 CRPC disease.67 This disease
setting exists because of the use of early, long-term ADT for
men with non-metastatic prostate cancer. If ADT is delayed
in men with biochemical failure after radical treatment until
the site of recurrence is detected, M0 CRPC will be unusual
because men will typically only develop castration-resistant
disease after the detection of metastases.
Apalutamide signiﬁcantly increased median metastasisfree survival (40.5 months versus 16.2 months, HR 0.28;
95% CI 0.23e0.35) and time to symptomatic progression
(HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.32e0.63) as compared with placebo in a
multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase III trial
(SPARTAN) conducted in 1207 men with high-risk M0 CRPC
(baseline PSA >2.0 ng/ml and a PSA doubling time of 10
months). Data on OS are still immature (HR 0.70; 95% CI
0.47e1.04). The most frequent side-effects observed in the
experimental arm were rash, hypertension, fracture, hypothyroidism and mental-impairment disorder.68
Enzalutamide was evaluated in patients with high-risk M0
CRPC (PROSPER trial). In 1401 patients, enzalutamide was
superior to placebo with regard to the primary end point of
median metastasis-free survival (36.6 months versus 14.7
months, HR 0.29; 95% CI 0.24e0.35), and the key secondary
end points of median time to PSA progression (37.2 versus
3.9 months; HR 0.07; 95% CI 0.05e0.08) and time to subsequent antineoplastic therapy (39.6 versus 17.7 months;
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.06.011

Annals of Oncology
HR 0.21; 95% CI 0.17e0.26). Data on OS are still immature.
Side-effects most commonly reported in the enzalutamide
group were fatigue, hypertension, adverse cardiovascular
events and mental-impairment disorders.69
Darolutamide was evaluated in the ARAMIS trial, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
phase III trial involving 1509 men with high-risk M0 CRPC
and a PSA doubling time of 10 months. Darolutamide
signiﬁcantly increased the median metastasis-free survival
compared with placebo (median 40.4 months versus 18.4
months; HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.34e0.50). Data on OS are
immature. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in
19.5% versus 24.7% of patients receiving placebo and darolutamide, respectively.70
Recommendation
 Apalutamide [ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3], darolutamide
[ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] or enzalutamide [ESMOMCBS v1.1 score: 3] should be considered as options
for men with M0 (on bone scan and CT) CRPC and a
high risk of disease progression [I, B].

METASTATIC CRPC
For men with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), both bicalutamide
and low-dose corticosteroids show a beneﬁt in terms of PSA
and symptomatic responses, but no randomised trials have
demonstrated a beneﬁt in OS.71,72
The combination of abiraterone acetate and prednisone
was compared with placebo plus prednisone in the COUAA-302 trial73 in >1000 men with ChT-naive, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC. Abiraterone signiﬁcantly
improved OS (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66e0.95). The main speciﬁc
side-effects were hypokalaemia, hypertension, oedema and
cardiac events. Low-dose abiraterone taken with food
appeared to have similar activity to standard dose abiraterone under fasting conditions74; however, this has not
been tested in phase III trials.
In the same setting, 1717 patients were treated with
enzalutamide or placebo in the PREVAIL trial.75 Enzalutamide was superior to placebo in terms of OS (HR 0.71; 95%
CI 0.60e0.84), with fatigue/asthenia and hypertension as
the most common adverse events.
The role of ChT in mCRPC was established in two phase III
randomised trials. In the TAX-327 trial, in a population of
1006 patients with mCRPC, docetaxel (75 mg/m2 3-weekly)
combined with prednisone signiﬁcantly increased OS as
compared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone (HR 0.76;
95% CI 0.62e0.94).76 Similarly, the SWOG-9916 trial
showed that the combination of docetaxel (60 mg/m2 3weekly), estramustine and prednisone was superior to
mitoxantrone plus prednisone in prolonging OS (HR 0.8;
95% CI 0.67e0.97). In both studies, docetaxel increased the
risk of myelosuppression, febrile neutropaenia, fatigue, alopecia, diarrhoea, neuropathy and peripheral oedema.77
The ALSYMPCA trial showed that the treatment with
radium-223 (223Ra), a bone-targeted alpha-emitter,
1128

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.06.011

signiﬁcantly increased OS (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.55e0.83) and
time to ﬁrst symptomatic skeletal event (HR 0.66; 95% CI
0.52e0.83) compared with placebo in 926 patients with
progressive bone-predominant, symptomatic mCRPC.78 Sideeffects of 223Ra include thrombocytopaenia (3% G3) and
diarrhoea (2% G3). Based on this trial, 223Ra was rated at the
highest level of the ESMO-MCBS [ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score:
5].79 However, the ERA-223 trial showed an increased incidence of fractures (28.6% versus 11.4%) among patients
receiving 223Ra in combination with abiraterone acetate plus
prednisone compared with patients receiving placebo in
combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone.80 The
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency has restricted the use of 223Ra to
patients who have received at least two lines of systemic
treatment of CRPC (abiraterone/enzalutamide and docetaxel) or who are ineligible to receive these therapies.81 The
administration of 223Ra in association with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone is not permitted.
In the post-docetaxel setting, cabazitaxel improved OS
(HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.59e0.83) compared with mitoxantrone
in 755 patients (TROPIC trial).82 The treatment was associated with increased myelosuppression, including febrile
neutropaenia and diarrhoea. Similarly, abiraterone plus
prednisone, tested against placebo plus prednisone in the
COU-301 study83 improved OS (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64e0.86).
Enzalutamide was tested against placebo in the postdocetaxel setting in the AFFIRM trial, and also improved
OS (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.53e0.75).84
The optimal sequence or combination of all these agents
is largely unknown. There is strong evidence suggesting
cross-resistance between abiraterone and enzalutamide. A
second AR inhibitor (abiraterone for those with prior
enzalutamide and vice versa) had only modest activity.85
The CARD trial compared cabazitaxel versus a second AR
inhibitor. The median OS was 13.6 months with cabazitaxel
and 11.0 months with the second androgen-signallingtargeted inhibitor (HR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46e0.89;
P ¼ 0.008). In the control arm, the response rate and the
duration of response to a second AR inhibitor were poor.86
In daily practice, sequencing decisions will be made in
light of the distribution, extent and pace of disease,
comorbidities, previous treatments (ChT or new hormone
agents), patient preferences and drug availability.
Recommendations
 Abiraterone or enzalutamide [ESMO-MCBS v1.1 scores:
4] is recommended for asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic men with ChT-naive mCRPC [I, A].
 Docetaxel [ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] is recommended
for men with mCRPC [I, A].
 In patients with mCRPC in the post-docetaxel setting,
abiraterone [ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4], enzalutamide
[ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] and cabazitaxel [ESMOMCBS v1.1 score: 3] are recommended options [I, A].
 In patients with bone metastases from CRPC at risk for
clinically signiﬁcant skeletal-related events (SREs), a

bisphosphonate or denosumab is recommended (see
section on palliative care) [I, B].
 223Ra [ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 5] is recommended for
men with bone-predominant, symptomatic mCRPC
without visceral metastases [I, B].
 223Ra is not recommended in combination with abiraterone and prednisolone [I, E].
 The use of a second AR inhibitor (abiraterone after enzalutamide or vice versa) is not recommended [II, D].

PRECISION MEDICINE
Various tissue-based molecular assays provide prognostic information, additional to conventional clinicopathological parameters, regarding outcomes of conservative management
and the likelihood of relapse following treatment of the primary.87,88 Assessment of their clinical utility would require
long-term prospective studies, and cost-effectiveness analyses.
AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7) detected in circulating tumour
cells is prognostic in CRPC.89 AR-V7-positive patients are less
likely to respond to abiraterone and enzalutamide than AR-V7negative patients,90 while AR-V7 status does not seem to affect
the response to taxanes.84 Prevalence of AR-V7 is low before
treatment but increases with subsequent therapy lines.84 Thus,
it would be of little use to investigate AR-V7 status in the
treatment-naive setting. Switching from one AR signalling inhibitor to another after disease progression is rarely effective,
and a therapy with a different mechanism of action (i.e. taxane)
would be preferable. Therefore, AR-V7 is of limited value for
therapy selection and cannot be recommended.
Actionable targets are identiﬁed in the majority of
advanced prostate tumours.91 Approximately 20% of metastatic prostate cancers harbour aberrations in genes involved
in DNA damage and repair (DDR) and BRCA2 is the most
commonly altered.91 A substantial proportion of these aberrations are also present in the germline.91 Prostate tumours
related to germline BRCA2 mutations often have GS 8,
nodal and distant metastases at diagnosis, but these genetic
variants cannot be excluded in patients without such clinicopathological features.92 Germline mutations in BRCA2 have
been associated with poor clinical outcomes across different
disease states92 while the prognostic implications of inheritable mutations in other DDR genes are less well established.
Importantly, 30% of metastatic prostate cancer patients
found to carry a germline DDR mutation did not have a previous family history of cancer.93 Due to the prevalence of
germline DDR in advanced prostate cancer (12%e16%),92
these patients should be offered germline screening regardless of tumour features at diagnosis or family history of
cancer. Men with localised prostate cancer should also be
considered for germline testing if at least two close blood
relatives on the same side of the family have been diagnosed
with tumours linked to hereditary cancer predisposition
syndromes (including breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic,
melanoma, sarcoma, adrenocortical, brain, colorectal,
endometrial, gastric, thyroid and kidney cancers).94 The
germline origin of pathogenic mutations affecting cancer-risk

genes identiﬁed by tumour sequencing should also be
investigated.95 There is limited evidence to guide prostate
cancer management based on germline status, but early
identiﬁcation of mutation carriers may contribute to the
prevention and early diagnosis of tumours in relatives.
Some germline and somatic mutations in genes involved in
the homologous recombination pathway, including BRCA2,
are potential predictors of response to platinum-based ChT
and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
inhibitors.96 Tumours with germline and somatic mismatch
repair defects are likely to respond to pembrolizumab.97,98
The PROFOUND trial tested olaparib versus a second AR
axis inhibitor in patients with mCRPC with alterations in any
of 15 genes with a role in DDR whose disease had progressed
on prior new hormonal agent therapy. In 245 patients who
had at least one alteration in BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM, olaparib
improved rPFS [HR 0.34 (0.25e0.47)] and OS [HR 0.64 (0.43e
0.97)].99 In the control arm, the response rate and the
duration of response to a second AR axis inhibitor was poor.
Recommendations
 Tissue-based molecular assays may be used in conjunction with clinicopathological factors for treatment decision making in localised prostate cancer [IV, C].
 Germline testing for BRCA2 and other DDR genes associated with cancer predisposition syndromes is recommended in patients with a family history of cancer and
should be considered in all patients with metastatic prostate cancer [III, B].
 Consider tumour testing for homologous recombination
genes and mismatch repair defects (or microsatellite
instability) in patients with mCRPC [II, B].
 Patients with pathogenic mutations in cancer-risk genes
identiﬁed through tumour testing should be referred for
germline testing and genetic counselling [IV, A].
 Olaparib can be considered after new hormonal agents
for patients with mCRPC with alteration in BRCA1 or
BRCA2 [I, B].

PALLIATIVE CARE
Fractionated versus single-fraction RT for bone pain has
been compared in multiple randomised trials. Singlefraction treatment provides similar pain relief.100 A recent
non-inferiority phase II trial indicated that the singlefraction dose of 14e16 Gy using SBRT results in a better
pain response than multifraction RT.101 Multifraction RT is
commonly used for bone metastatic disease associated with
complications such as nerve root compression from soft
tissue extension.
Zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate, was shown to prolong
time to ﬁrst SREs, namely fracture, spinal cord compression,
surgery or RT for bone pain or a change in anticancer
treatment of bone pain.102 However, there was no difference in disease progression, OS or QoL. Adverse effects
included anaemia, fever, myalgia and osteonecrosis of the
jaw (ONJ). Denosumab, a receptor activator of nuclear

Annals of Oncology
factor kappa-b ligand inhibitor, has been compared with
zoledronic acid.103 Denosumab was superior with respect to
time to ﬁrst SRE (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.71e0.95, P ¼ 0.0002),
but was associated with an increased risk of hypocalcaemia
(13% versus 6%) and a trend towards higher incidence of
ONJ (2.3% versus 1.3%). There was no difference in OS.
The management of mCRPC has changed markedly since
the trials of zoledronic acid and denosumab were done.
Abiraterone, enzalutamide, corticosteroids and 223Ra all increase the risk of fragility fractures but reduce the risk of other
SREs. These changes have heightened awareness of the
importance of bone health (see below) in men on ADT. If the
bone health recommendations are followed, the added value
of zoledronic acid or denosumab for SRE prevention is unclear.
Spinal cord compression is a devastating complication of
metastatic prostate cancer and early detection is critical for
successful management. A systematic review found that
spinal cord compression is a common ﬁnding, even in
asymptomatic patients with metastatic prostate cancer and
spinal metastases.50
Beta-emitting, bone-seeking radionuclides such as
strontium-89 and samarium-153 hydroxyethylidene
diphosphonate (89Sr-HEDP and 153Sm-HEDP) have proven
symptomatic beneﬁts in the treatment of mCRPC. However,
their use is limited by myelotoxicity and they have largely
been superseded by 223Ra.

Lifestyle measures (weight-bearing exercise, stopping
smoking, two or fewer units of alcohol daily and adequate
calcium intake and vitamin D status) help to maintain bone
health. Treatment with an oral bisphosphonate, such as
alendronic acid, reduces the incidence of fractures.105
Alendronic acid should be taken after an overnight fast, at
least 30 min before food, drink or other medicines. Whole
tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water. Patients
should remain upright for 30 min. If an oral bisphosphonate
is not tolerated, zoledronic acid every 12 months or denosumab every 6 months are appropriate alternatives.

Recommendations
 Lifestyle measures to maintain bone health are recommended for men on ADT: weight-bearing exercise, stopping smoking, two or fewer units alcohol daily, adequate
calcium intake and vitamin D status (reach and maintain
reference vitamin D levels) [IV, B].
 Men starting long-term ADT should:
B either be offered an oral bisphosphonate [I, B].
B or be monitored with DEXA scanning and then treated
according to the ESMO guidelines for CTIBL66 [IV, B].

METHODOLOGY
Recommendations
 A single fraction of external beam RT is recommended
for palliation of painful, uncomplicated bone metastasis
[I, A].
 In patients with bone metastases from CRPC at risk for
clinically signiﬁcant SREs, a bisphosphonate or denosumab is recommended [I, B].
 MRI of the spine to detect subclinical cord compression
is recommended in men with CRPC with vertebral metastases [III, B].
 Urgent MRI of the spine to detect cord compression is
very strongly recommended in men with CRPC with
vertebral metastases and neurological symptoms [III, A].

FOLLOW-UP AND LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS
ADT may cause hot ﬂushes, lethargy, mood changes, osteoporosis, insulin resistance and muscle loss. Because survival in mCRPC has improved substantially, men are living
longer on ADT. Taken together with the adverse effects on
bone health of abiraterone, enzalutamide, steroids and
223
Ra, bone health in men with prostate cancer is an
increasingly important issue. The FRAX® (Fracture Risk
Assessment Tool) score to estimate the risk of fragility
fracture is not directly applicable to such men because it
does not include a correction speciﬁcally for use of ADT. The
risk of fragility fracture in men on long-term ADT exceeds
accepted intervention thresholds. Even before starting ADT,
a large proportion of men diagnosed with prostate cancer
have osteopaenia or osteoporosis.104
