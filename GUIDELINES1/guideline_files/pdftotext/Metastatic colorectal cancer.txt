INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer
worldwide, with 1.1 million new cases per year, and is the
second leading cause of cancer death.1 CRC occurs more
frequently in middle- to high-income countries with an
eightfold variation in incidence across the world. This rise
may be associated with known risk factors, including
alcohol intake, tobacco use, obesity, sedentariness and
dietary patterns (diets low in fruits, vegetables and unreÔ¨Åned plant food, and high in red meat, processed foods and
fat).1,2
In Europe in 2018, CRC accounted for the second highest
number of cancer deaths. However, mortality has declined
since 2012.2 In middle- to high-income countries this reÔ¨Çects screening and early detection programmes, better
therapeutic approaches (systemic therapies, biomarkerguided integration of biologicals, resection of metastases
and local ablative therapies), allowing more patients the
opportunity of prolonged disease control, and even cure.
Approximately 15%-30% of patients present with metastases, and 20%-50% of patients with initially localised

disease will develop metastases. The most common location
of metastases being liver, then lung, peritoneum and distant
lymph nodes.
This European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)
Guideline describes improvements in diagnosis, staging
and treatment of metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients, which
have contributed to the current ‚Äòstate-of-the-art‚Äô treatment approaches, and provides guidance for the
comprehensive management of patients with mCRC.
DIAGNOSIS, PATHOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
A clinical or biological suspicion of mCRC should always be
conÔ¨Årmed by adequate radiological imaging and histology
of the primary tumour or metastases before the administration of any therapy.
Tissue handling procedures should be optimised to allow
biomarker testing. Fixation with 10% neutral buffered
formalin (4% formaldehyde) for no less than 6 h and no
more than 48 h is recommended. The primary pathologist
should review all available tumour specimens and enrich
samples by macro-dissection to maximise tumour cell content (>20%) before DNA extraction.
Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2022.10.003, describes biomarkers and molecular targets for precision medicines and corresponding
ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets
(ESCAT) scores. Testing for mismatch repair (MMR) status
and KRAS, NRAS exon 2, 3 and 4 as well as BRAF mutations
is recommended in all patients at the time of mCRC

diagnosis, due to its relevance in selecting Ô¨Årst-line therapy.
This can be carried out on either the primary tumour or any
metastatic site, with a suggested turnaround of 10 days.
As these mutations are negative predictive factors for the
use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), RAS testing is mandatory
before this treatment is initiated.3-5 Laboratories providing
RAS testing should demonstrate successful participation in a
relevant external quality assessment scheme. In situations
where adequate tissue is not available, exclusion of a RAS
mutation status can be conducted by analysing plasmaderived cell-free DNA.6-8
BRAF V600E mutation is a strong negative prognostic
factor in mCRC. BRAF mutation status should be assessed
simultaneously with RAS testing for prognostication. Additionally, treatment with cetuximabeencorafenib has shown
better response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) than treatment with irinotecanecetuximab in
BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC in second- and third-line treatment.9 Non-V600E class III BRAF mutations are not associated with a worse prognosis, while the role of class II
mutations remains unclear.10
DeÔ¨Åcient mismatch repair (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI) testing in mCRC can assist clinicians with genetic
counselling, including for identiÔ¨Åcation of Lynch syndrome,
and should be done to select patients for immune checkpoint
inhibition (ICI) as part of the initial molecular work-up.11-13
IdentiÔ¨Åcation of human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2) ampliÔ¨Åcation by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or
FISH is recommended in RAS wild-type (wt) patients to
detect those who may beneÔ¨Åt from HER2 blockade.14 For
practical reasons, this could be done with the initial molecular tests, but anti-HER2 inhibition is only recommended
in second and further lines. Therefore, the HER2 ampliÔ¨Åcation will only inÔ¨Çuence a treatment plan after at least Ô¨Årstline progression.
Testing of other biomarkers including ALK and ROS1 gene
fusions, mutations of PIK3CA and HER2 activating mutations
is not (yet) recommended outside clinical trials. NTRK fusions are extremely uncommon in mCRC with an incidence
of <0.5%; however, testing is recommended when feasible.
Screening for NTRK fusions can be carried out by IHC,
followed by conÔ¨Årmation with next generation sequencing.
Most NTRK-rearranged tumours are located in the right
colon and are frequently MSI-high (MSI-H). NTRK testing
could be done at any time but will only inÔ¨Çuence treatment
decisions after progression on at least two lines of
treatment. In the rare event of an NTRK fusion detected
after a comprehensive genomic analysis, including RNA,
treatment with larotrectinib or entrectinib is recommended.15-18
As Ô¨Çuoropyrimidines [e.g. 5-Ô¨Çuorouracil (5-FU) and
capecitabine] are utilised in most mCRC patients, testing for
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deÔ¨Åciency should
be conducted before initiating these drugs; please refer to
the ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on localised
colon cancer for further guidance.19 For triÔ¨Çuridinee
tipiracil, DPD testing is not required.

Recommendations
 For biomarker testing, Ô¨Åxation with 10% neutral buffered formalin (4% formaldehyde) for no less than 6 h
and no more than 48 h is recommended [V, A].
 The primary pathologist should review all available
tumour specimens and enrich samples by macrodissection to maximise tumour cell content (>20%)
before DNA extraction [IV, A].
 Testing for MMR status and KRAS, NRAS exon 2, 3 and 4
and BRAF mutations is recommended in all patients at
the time of mCRC diagnosis [I, A].
 RAS testing is mandatory before treatment with antiEGFR mAbs and can be carried out on either the primary
tumour or other metastatic sites [III, A].
 BRAF mutation status should be assessed simultaneously with the evaluation of RAS, for prognostic
assessment [I, B] and for the option of treatment with
cetuximabeencorafenib [I, A].
 dMMR/MSI testing in mCRC can assist in genetic
counselling for Lynch syndrome [II, B].
 dMMR/MSI status is also recommended as the initial
molecular work-up in metastatic disease for its predictive value for the use of ICIs [I, A].
 IdentiÔ¨Åcation of HER2 ampliÔ¨Åcation by IHC or FISH is
recommended in RAS-wt patients to detect those who
may beneÔ¨Åt from HER2 blockade [III, B].
 Testing of other biomarkers including ALK and ROS1 gene
fusions, mutations of PIK3CA and HER2 activating mutations is not recommended outside clinical trials [IV, D].
 In the rare event that an NTRK fusion is detected by IHC
and/or comprehensive genomic analysis, treatment with
larotrectinib or entrectinib is recommended [III, A].
 Testing for DPD deÔ¨Åciency has to be conducted before
initiating 5-FU-based chemotherapy (ChT) [III, A].

STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT
After diagnosis of mCRC, apart from a complete medical
history and physical examination, a complete blood count
and biochemical laboratory testing should be carried out,
including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and, optionally,
carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9) levels.
Staging is carried out primarily with imaging techniques,
usually contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of
the thorax, abdomen and pelvis. Valuable additions are
abdominopelvic ultrasonography, preferably with speciÔ¨Åc
contrast enhancers, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MRI is the preferred choice in case of colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) amenable to local treatment (LT), to
accurately deÔ¨Åne the number and location of metastases.20
The same radiological technique should be used at baseline
and for response assessment after therapy. An [18F]2-Ô¨Çuoro2-deoxy-D-glucoseepositron emission tomography (FDGe
PET) scan can be useful, particularly in patients with
increased tumour markers without evidence of metastatic
disease, or to deÔ¨Åne the extent of metastatic disease on
potentially resectable metastases.

At mCRC diagnosis different risk factors should be
considered. Patients with a higher Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (PS) have worse
prognosis, which can be due to advanced disease stage at
diagnosis and/or because they are unÔ¨Åt for active
treatment.21
Proximal colon tumours located before the splenic Ô¨Çexure
have different embryological origins and patterns of molecular characteristics compared with distal tumours.22
Proximal tumours are more frequently mucinous, associated with an inÔ¨Çammatory response, with dMMR/MSI-H
and hypermutated, with a higher frequency of KRAS and
BRAF mutations.23 In contrast, distal colon tumours more
frequently have chromosomal alterations, ampliÔ¨Åcation of
EGFR and HER2 genes and aberrant EGFR signalling. In
mCRC, patients with proximal colon tumours have a worse
prognosis, independently of the applied treatments.
Resection of the primary tumour is sometimes necessary
because of obstructive symptoms or bleeding; however,
when asymptomatic it is not recommended in unresectable
metastatic disease. Although data from retrospective
studies recommend resection of the primary tumour,24-26
randomised trials speciÔ¨Åcally addressing this could not
conÔ¨Årm survival advantage in patients with synchronous
unresectable metastases.27,28
The role of multidisciplinary teams and tumour boards in
the assessment of mCRC patients
Improved clinical outcomes are seen when treatment approaches for individual mCRC patients are discussed within
a multidisciplinary team (MDT) of experts who meet regularly to review mCRC cases.29 The core MDT should include
representation from medical oncology, pathology, diagnostic radiology, radiation oncology, colorectal and hepatobiliary surgery, gastroenterology and stomatherapy
(Supplementary Table S2, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2022.10.003). Further expertise may be
required from surgeons with peritoneal metastasis expertise, thoracic surgeons, interventional radiologists and nuclear medicine specialists. If not available in a local MDT, an
established referral route should exist with a specialised
cancer centre (virtual MDTs) to ensure equity of access to
optimal care.30
The MDT has an ongoing role throughout the mCRC
patient pathway, initially to review the diagnostic work-up
to deÔ¨Åne whether or not a patient has clearly resectable
or unresectable metastatic disease and to consider management of the primary tumour.31,32 Patients deÔ¨Åned as
initially unresectable could have a second reassessment of
resectability, preferably within 2-3 months of starting
therapy, as proposed by an expert consensus.33
Conversely, when disease is deemed ‚Äònever to be resectable‚Äô, subsequent discussions may be managed by the
treating medical oncologist and patient regarding pros
and cons of various approaches and sequences, based on
the perceived aims.

Recommendations
 Staging is carried out primarily with imaging techniques,
such as a contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax, abdomen
and pelvis [IV, A].
 A liver MRI is recommended to characterise non-typical
liver lesions on CT scans or when liver metastases
seem resectable or potentially resectable [IV, A].
 An FDGePET scan can be useful, particularly in patients
with increased tumour markers without evidence of metastatic disease, or to deÔ¨Åne the extent of metastatic disease on potentially resectable metastases [IV, B].
 Resection of an asymptomatic primary tumour in patients with unresectable metastatic disease cannot be
recommended as standard of care [I, D].
MANAGEMENT OF RESECTABLE/POTENTIALLY RESECTABLE
DISEASE
Treatment of potentially resectable mCRC
Surgical resection of R0-resectable (resectable, leaving no
tumour at the margin) CRLMs is a potentially curative
treatment, with reported 5-year survival rates of 20%-45%.
The criteria for R0-resectability of CRLMs depend on technical and oncological (prognostic) criteria and on the
experience of the MDT.
Technically, resectability is not limited by number, size or
bilobar metastatic involvement, if tumours may be resected
leaving sufÔ¨Åcient remnant organ (e.g. 30% remnant liver).
Other ablative techniques, such as thermal ablation (TA) or
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), may be added to
surgery to achieve a complete treatment or provide an
alternative to resection if inoperable due to frailty or poor
anatomical location for resection.
‚ÄòOncological‚Äô criteria concern prognostic factors that
impact disease-free survival (DFS) or the likelihood of cure.
Characteristics including onset of metastatic disease (synchronous versus metachronous), clinical aggressiveness of
the tumour as well as concomitant extrahepatic disease
could lead to the recommendation of a neoadjuvant strategy instead of upfront surgery to get ‚Äòthe proof of time‚Äô for
a well-controlled disease and are seen as relevant factors.
Indeed, up to 55%-80% of patients will experience relapse
following metastatic resection, the majority occurring in the
resected organ. Biological determinants including RAS, BRAF
or dMMR/MSI mutational status may also inÔ¨Çuence treatment strategy. Despite the recognised poor prognosis in
some cohorts, patients with BRAF-mutant mCRC who underwent R0 resection of all metastatic lesions had comparable outcomes to their BRAF-wt counterparts. Despite
limited evidence, the exclusion of these patients from a
potentially curative approach does not seem justiÔ¨Åed.
With very favourable prognostic criteria and a good
technical resectability, perioperative systemic treatment
may not be needed. Conversely, unfavourable criteria
mandate the use of ‚Äòbest systemic treatment‚Äô options. In
patients with an unclear prognostic situation, systemic

treatment should be initiated to gain more prognostic insights by observation. The use of perioperative leucovorin
(LV)e5-FUeoxaliplatin (FOLFOX) ChT, 3 months pre- and
post-operatively in patients with technically ‚Äòeasy-to-resect‚Äô
resectable CRLMs but with negative prognostic factors, has
been positively proven and can be considered as a standard
of care in this circumstance (EORTC 40983 trial).34,35
Most patients have metastatic disease that is not initially
suitable for potentially curative resection. It is, however,
important to select patients with resectable metastases and
those with initially unresectable disease in whom resection
may be possible after a major response with systemic
therapy. The aim of treatment here should be to convert
initially unresectable disease to resectable. Median survival
rates after resection are two- to threefold higher than in
patients treated with systemic therapy alone, with a potential of cure.32
Resection of lung metastases offers 25%-35% 5-year
survival rates in carefully selected patients. Resection of
lung metastases in conjunction with resection of CRLMs has
also shown survival beneÔ¨Åt.34,36
In selected patients with limited peritoneal metastasis,
complete cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal ChT (HIPEC) may provide prolonged survival
when carried out in experienced high-volume centres (in
view of the relatively high morbidity associated with the
procedure).37-39 This observation, however, has not been
conÔ¨Årmed in randomised, phase III trials and therefore
cannot be recommended as standard of care. A recent
phase III trial (PRODIGE 7) has failed to show the added
value of an oxaliplatin-based HIPEC on cytoreductive surgery. Indeed, the PRODIGE 7 trial reported the absence of
an OS beneÔ¨Åt after adding HIPEC to cytoreductive surgery
and more frequent post-operative late complications with
this combination, in patients with colorectal peritoneal
metastases.40 There are ongoing trials to see if other HIPEC
regimens (using mitomycin and different HIPEC procedures)
may possibly lead to better outcomes.
Ovariectomy, lymphadenectomy and resection of
selected other single metastases have also shown survival
beneÔ¨Åt in patient series.32
Primarily technically R0-resectable CRLMs. In patients with
‚Äòfavourable‚Äô oncological criteria (e.g. metachronous lesions,
fewer metastases, unilobar disease, no extrahepatic disease), upfront resection should be done. The only phase III
trial (dedicated to CRLMs) conducted in this situation
showed a beneÔ¨Åt in DFS but a non-signiÔ¨Åcant improvement
in OS if perioperative treatment with FOLFOX is
administered.34,41
In patients with ‚Äòunfavourable‚Äô oncological criteria (synchronous lesions, more than three metastases, bilobar disease, limited extrahepatic disease) and ‚Äòfavourable surgical‚Äô
criteria (e.g. no vascular inÔ¨Åltration), perioperative ChT,
preferably with any Ô¨Çuoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin, should
be proposed.
Attention should be paid to the presence of small metastases (10-15 mm), which may disappear while on

systemic therapy, with the risk of being missed during surgery while still active in terms of presence of tumour cells.
In this situation, neoadjuvant ChT should not exceed 2
months if indicated; upfront surgery or other interventional
approaches such as a percutaneous destruction should also
be discussed with the MDT. For patients in whom the metastases have disappeared on standard imaging, microscopic disease is often still present and an MDT discussion
of the optimal strategy is required.
Post-operative ChT can be delivered, but the randomised
evidence to support this is scarce and therefore it cannot be
considered as standard of care. Fluoropyrimidineeoxaliplatin-based ChT for 6 months after resection of metastases
may improve outcomes unless patients failed a prior adjuvant treatment (oxaliplatin-based) for stage II or III disease
within 12 months. Targeted agents are not recommended
during perioperative therapy in patients with upfront
resectable metastases.35,42 Perioperative or post-operative
adjuvant treatment strategy decisions may be inÔ¨Çuenced
by ‚Äòbiology of the disease‚Äô, the timing of onset of metastases
(synchronous versus metachronous), technical criteria for
resectability (or ablation) and/or the number and size of
metastases.
For patients who relapse within 6 months after
oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy (potentially resistant to
this treatment and often with a persistent sensitive neuropathy), an MDT discussion of the optimal individual
strategy is required. If a preoperative strategy is chosen,
treatment selection should reÔ¨Çect this situation and the
‚Äòbest available systemic treatment‚Äô should be used.
Potentially resectable metastatic disease, conversion
therapy. The addition of a targeted agent to a cytotoxic
doublet or triplet is the most effective treatment in mCRC.
For efÔ¨Åcacy assessment, overall response rate (ORR) seems
to be the best parameter in direct and cross-trial
comparisons.
Anti-EGFR mAbs in RAS-wt patients with left-sided primary tumours are more effective than bevacizumab-based
combinations.43,44
According to cross-trial comparisons, LVe5-FUeoxaliplatineirinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) with and without bevacizumab
also resulted in high ORRs.45-47
In patients with RAS-mutant disease, a cytotoxic triplete
bevacizumab and, to a lesser extent, a cytotoxic doublete
bevacizumab are considered the best choice in patients
who may tolerate this intensive approach.
Resection of the metastases should be carried out 3-4
weeks from the previous administration of ChT alone or
ChTeanti-EGFR mAbs, or at least 5 weeks after ChTe
bevacizumab (if bevacizumab has not been omitted from
the last cycle). It should be carried out as soon as the
metastases, as a result of size reduction, are technically
resectable, since unnecessarily prolonged administration of
ChT may lead to increased liver toxicity and thus, higher
post-operative morbidity.36
Surgery following systemic treatment could be more
challenging than for initially resectable patients. SpeciÔ¨Åc
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.10.003

techniques, such as portal embolisation, resection combined
with radiofrequency ablation (RFA)/microwave ablation
(MWA) or two-stage hepatectomy, may be applied further.
Also, patients unresponsive to Ô¨Årst-line ChT should not be
denied liver resection since the outcome of resected patients
after second-line ChT could also be favourable. This approach
needs frequent assessment of response to indicate surgery at
the right moment. Intra-arterial ChT could be an option in
such patients, to both recover a response and to achieve liver
resection.48,49 The management of these patients requires a
particular dedication and expertise within the team.50,51
After surgery, re-uptake of the previous systemic treatmentdwith the same regimendcan be considered, speciÔ¨Åcally if pathological response has occurred, but there is
no evidence from randomised studies to support this
approach. Generally, the total treatment duration should
not exceed 6 months. New approaches, such as intraarterial post-operative adjuvant treatments, are currently
under investigation in randomised studies.52
LTs in management of patients with oligometastatic
disease
Management of oligometastatic disease. The deÔ¨Ånition of
oligometastatic disease (OMD) is important as treatment
strategies should be based on the possibility of achieving
eradication of all metastases and/or a ‚Äòno evidence of disease‚Äô (NED) status, either initially or after systemic therapy.
Generally, a traditional clinical deÔ¨Ånition of OMD is:
 One to Ô¨Åve metastatic lesions, occasionally more if complete eradication is possible
 Up to two metastatic sites
 Controlled primary tumour (optionally resected)
 All metastatic sites must be safely treatable by LT
OMD status has therefore been established by radiological appearances and clinical judgment. Currently, biological
factors do not contribute to this deÔ¨Ånition, but this may
change considering, for example, molecular subtypes with
speciÔ¨Åc prognostic background and/or treatment implications. Notably, OMD status can occur in multiple clinical
scenarios in the continuum of care, e.g. during different
treatment lines. Therefore, careful and continuous reassessment is recommended.
Consideration should be given to relevant factors in the
OMD setting:
 Disease-related factors, e.g. size, number and localisation
of metastatic sites, status of primary tumour, previous
treatment-free intervals, previous treatments and their
respective outcome, overall prognosis
 Surgery and other LT-related factors, e.g. technical ability
to treat and/or to achieve a locally complete eradication.
This must be discussed versus potential toxicity and the
invasiveness of the technique and the alternatives
(mostly, continuation or initiation of systemic treatment)
 Patient-related factors, e.g. PS, frailty and comorbidity,
Ô¨Åtness for systemic treatment and LT, individual treatment goals and preferences
14

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.10.003

Assessment for LT of OMD must include an optimal imaging strategy before LT: generally, a contrast-enhanced CT
scan, with MRI, ultrasound, PET and others. Specialist MDT
input and thorough patient assessment and counselling are
warranted.
The selection of the best LT for OMD differs according to:
 The size, number and localisation of the metastases
 The expected likelihood of complete eradication
 The invasiveness of the chosen technique
 The local expertise with regard to the use of a particular
LT method
 Consideration of patient frailty, life expectancy and
preferences
The integration of LT into the therapeutic continuum of
care can be:
 As a deÔ¨Ånitive eradication in limited disease. Usually, surgery will be used for this goal, but a nonsurgical LT only if
tumour characteristics (e.g. localisation) and/or patient
factors would limit the surgical approach.
 As a replacement for surgery; mostly in prognostically
unclear situations or after response to systemic treatment in more widespread disease.
 As a primary or metastasis-speciÔ¨Åc treatment to halt
further dissemination. This could delay (or even eliminate) the need for systemic treatment. This can be
used as an initial treatment for slowly progressing
tumours.
 As a consolidative treatment, following systemic therapy
to delay or pause further treatment.
OMD should be considered a speciÔ¨Åc situation in mCRC
treatment. OMD management will, generally, in most cases
start with induction ChT treatment, with response (or at
least disease stabilisation) being a strong predictor for a
favourable prognosis, justifying the enhanced local control
by LT. However, in favourable prognostic situations with
limited metastatic spread, upfront LT (without preceding
systemic therapy) is a standard of care. LT is an option in
oligo-progressive disease (i.e. very limited recurrence/nonresponse in a patient receiving systemic treatment). Such
OMD could be construed as a result of intra-tumour heterogeneity. The aim of LT here is to eliminate the cell clones
no longer responding to treatment and to enable the
continuation of the systemic therapy.
Intent of treatment and choice of LT
Curative treatment approaches. A complete eradication
of tumour can be obtained using surgical R0 resection and/
or A0 ablation (evidence of ablation margins and NED at
follow-up imaging). For patients with OMD conÔ¨Åned to a
single organ (most frequently liver or lung), or a few organs
or sites (pre-dominantly visceral metastases, e.g. liver and
lung), a potentially curative approach exists. In this setting,
long-term survival or even cure can be attained in 20%-45%
of patients who undergo complete R0 resection or complete A0 TA of their metastases.53-55

Annals of Oncology

In the absence of randomised trials comparing surgical
with nonsurgical disease management, surgery has
remained the standard treatment approach for patients
with resectable OMD. However, TA and radiotherapy achieve high rates of complete tumour eradication of small
metastases and can be seen as alternatives if a widely
invasive surgical approach is required.55-58
Patients with liver and lung metastases have a better
prognosis than those with other metastatic disease locations. For example, as limited lung metastases are associated with slower growth and prolonged survival, a ‚Äòwatch
and wait‚Äô strategy with regular surveillance imaging may
also be appropriate.59,60 The data showing different outcomes depending on the site(s) of OMD are likely to reÔ¨Çect
molecular differences. Selection of the best ‚Äòsituationadapted‚Äô treatment strategy should consider all of these
factors as part of an MDT treatment decision before the
start of systemic treatment and at the time of best
response.
Use of LT with non-curative intent. For patients with
more extensive disease, the value of an LT may contribute
to long-term survival or a prolonged PFS, but is rarely
curative.61 Here, LT is part of a multimodal therapy
approach to provide well-controlled sites of metastases
with optional discontinuation of systemic therapy, with the
goal of long-term disease control and potentially improved
OS. For example, the reported median ChT-free survival
after TA of lung metastases from CRC was 12.2 months in
the overall population and 20.9 months in lung-only metastases patients.62
Modalities for LT in OMD. Modalities for LT are summarised in Figure 1. Management of OMD is outlined in
Supplementary Figure S1, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2022.10.003.

Surgery. Treatment should aim to achieve complete
resection of all tumour masses, using surgical resection
and/or nonsurgical interventions.
For patients with resectable OMD conÔ¨Åned to a single
organ (most frequently liver or lung) and/or a few organs
(and even localised peritoneal spread), surgery remains the
standard and best (potentially) curative treatment
approach. Operative resection of metastases must be seen
in the context of prognostic information and technical
limitations.
Local ablation techniques. Thermal ablation. TA such as
RFA has a limitation inherent to size range of maximum 2-3
cm.63 Safety margin of ablation is a strong predictor of
complete eradication.55,64 In the randomised phase II
CLOCC trial (ChT plus RFA  surgical resection versus ChT
alone, for patients with a median of four CRLMs), an
improvement in PFS and in OS was reported.65
Data on the use of TA in combination with liver resection
in an effort to obtain NED demonstrate improved perioperative outcomes without compromising long-term survival
compared with bilateral resection.36,66 Data on TAs other
than RFA are limited, but outcome appears similar between
RFA and MWA, with ablative margins predictive for complete eradication of the targeted disease with both technologies, and a possible better control of perivascular
tumours with MWA.55
A meta-analysis supports surgery to provide better local
control and longer OS for CRLMs.67 Reported differences
were due to limitations of TA technologies, operator
experience and insufÔ¨Åcient safety margins applied, or subject to possible patient selection bias. TA applied to patients
who previously beneÔ¨Åtted from surgery improves liverspeciÔ¨Åc PFS,65 leading to the utilisation of RFA as a valid
treatment option for recurrent disease after surgical

In patients with unresectable CRLMs only, or OMD in the liver,TA can be considered for small metastases [III, B]. In patients with lung-only metastases or OMD including lung
lesions, TA may be considered along with resection, according to tumour size, number, location, the extent of lung parenchyma loss, comorbidity or other factors [III, B].

resection in small CRLMs.68-71 Randomised clinical trials are
ongoing to accurately assess surgery versus TA in CRLMs
(COLLISION study).
TA techniques also have proven efÔ¨Åcacy in the ablation of
lung metastases: local control rates of 88%-94% at 1 year and
77%-90% at 3 years have been reported.54,56,72,73 Similarly,
margins and volume of ablation are more predictive of
complete tumour eradication than type of TA used.74 Mortality and major complication rates may be as low as 1%.75 A
systematic review concluded that a Ô¨Årm conclusion could
not be drawn with regard to the use of surgery or RFA.76
SBRT. High conformal hypo-fractionated SBRT of metastases has been reported with a large range of local control
rates of 31%-90% after 2 years, including 80% for liver and
lung metastases, but also for lymph nodes.57,58 The risk of
failure correlates with tumour size as well as biologically
effective dose and motion management both for lung and
CRLMs.77-79 Across several series, no grade 3 events were
recorded. SBRT is considered an effective and safe ablative
treatment, but with no large prospective study available.
Therefore, with the beneÔ¨Åt of short treatment time, lack of
a need for recovery and favourable overall toxicity proÔ¨Åle,
SBRT is a treatment option, although it is yet unclear which
patients beneÔ¨Åt most. The OLIVER trial (NCT03296839) aims
to evaluate the impact of SBRT versus ChT alone, while
another randomised trial aims to compare MWA and SBRT
for inoperable CRLMs (NCT02820194).
Intra-arterial
therapies.
Transarterial
chemoembolisation. The data on transarterial chemoembolisation
(TACE) for CRLMs are mostly related to the use of
irinotecan-based drug-eluting microspheres (DEBIRI),
including two randomised studies. Despite signiÔ¨Åcant limitations in design and analysis of both, DEBIRI compared
with LVe5-FUeirinotecan (FOLFIRI) resulted in statistically
signiÔ¨Åcant improved OS and PFS,80 whereas FOLFOXebevacizumabeDEBIRI (FOLFOXeDEBIRI) reported improved
response rate (RR), downsizing to resection and PFS
compared with FOLFOXebevacizumab.81 In the neoadjuvant setting, DEBIRI is reported as safe and feasible,
yielding pathological major or complete response in >77%
of targeted lesions.82 A review of DEBIRI data, including 850
patients reported ORR of 56.2% and median PFS and OS of
8.1 and 16.8 months, respectively.83 In the chemorefractory setting, a new microspheres/irinotecan formulation demonstrated an ORR of 83% and median OS (mOS) of
14 months.84
Transarterial radioembolisation/selective internal radiation therapy. Transarterial radioembolisation (TARE)/
selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) typically involves
a single delivery of a radionuclide [yttrium (Y)-90, or holmium-166],85,86 connected to either resin or glass particles,
or bio-resorbable poly (L-lactic acid) microspheres as a delivery platform into the hepatic artery with the therapeutic
effect essentially limited to irradiation.
For patients with liver-limited metastases failing the
available chemotherapeutic options, TARE with Y-90 resin

microspheres has prolonged time to tumour progression
and time to liver progression, in a small, randomised
study.87
However, aggregated data of >1000 patients treated
within three randomised studies failed to show a beneÔ¨Åt in
OS,88 when TARE was added to the Ô¨Årst cycle of an
investigator-determined ‚Äòbest systemic treatment‚Äô. A randomised phase III study of TARE with resin microspheres failed
to show an overall PFS (as primary endpoint) beneÔ¨Åt, whilst a
signiÔ¨Åcantly better ‚Äòliver-speciÔ¨Åc-PFS‚Äô was documented.89 In
this trial, 45% of patients had the primary tumour in place and
40% had extrahepatic disease, suggesting that TARE may be
most beneÔ¨Åcial in patients with liver-limited or liverpredominant disease. Another potential subgroup with a
distinct beneÔ¨Åt is patients with right-sided primary
tumour.88,90
A recent further phase III trial compared second-line ChT
alone with second-line ChT plus transarterial Y-90 glass
microspheres in 428 patients with liver-dominant or liveronly disease (EPOCH trial). A signiÔ¨Åcant improvement in
PFS (as primary endpoint) was documented and ORRs were
21.1% and 34.0% for ChT alone and ChT plus TARE,
respectively. A subgroup analysis suggested PFS beneÔ¨Åt may
be more dominant in patients with fewer than three lesions, resected primary tumour, lower tumour burden, left
primary tumour location (PTL) and a KRAS mutation.
Hepatic arterial infusion ChT. Hepatic arterial infusion
ChT (HAIC) is carried out through intra-arterial ports or
pumps placed surgically or percutaneously.91 The most
commonly used drugs are Ô¨Çoxuridine (FUDR) and
oxaliplatin, infused through ports. The European experience
is mostly linked with intra-arterial oxaliplatin over 2 h and
systemic 5-FUeLV delivered over 48 h. HAIC with oxaliplatin
demonstrated 62% ORR in heavily pre-treated patients with
more than ninefold higher complete pathological response
than systemic therapy.92,93 The phase II OPTILIV study with
HAIC with irinotecaneoxaliplatine5-FU combined with
intravenous (i.v.) cetuximab met its primary endpoint of
conversion to R0-R1 (microscopic tumour at the margin)
hepatectomy in 29.7% of 64 RAS-wt pre-treated patients
bearing a median of 10 CRLMs involving six segments of the
liver.49
Recommendations
Treatment of potentially resectable mCRC
 In patients with resectable metastases and with favourable prognostic criteria and a good surgical approach,
perioperative systemic treatment may not be needed
[III, B].
 In patients with resectable metastases, the use of perioperative oxaliplatin-based ChT is recommended where
the prognostic situation is unclear [II, B].
 Anti-EGFR mAbs in left-sided RAS-wt patients should be
used as conversion therapy, when complete resection is
the aim [II, A].
 In patients with right-sided and RAS-mutant disease,
FOLFOXIRIebevacizumab and, to a lesser extent, a

cytotoxic doubletebevacizumab should be considered
the best choice depending on patients‚Äô ability to tolerate
triplet ChT [II, A].
 Patients unresponsive to Ô¨Årst-line ChT should not be denied resection or ablation of metastases since the
outcome of resected patients after second-line treatment could be also favourable. Intra-arterial ChT could
be an option in such patients, not only to recover a
response but also to achieve liver resection [III, C].
 In case of a peritoneal metastasis only, complete cytoreductive surgery should be carried out [II, A]. The addition
of HIPEC can be considered as an experimental procedure,
still to be validated in clinical trials. Therefore, its use
cannot be recommended outside of this setting [II, D].
Intent and choice of local treatment
 Treatment approaches for all patients with mCRC should
be discussed within an MDT of experts (especially in LT)
who meet regularly to review OMD cases [V, A].
 LT can be used as a primary or metastasis-speciÔ¨Åc treatment to halt further dissemination, and/or following systemic therapy as a consolidation treatment, to delay or
pause further treatment [III, C].
 Frequent radiological re-evaluations of the potential
applicability of surgery or other LT techniques should
be carried out, generally every 8-12 weeks [IV, A].
Local ablation treatment
 In patients with unresectable CRLMs only, or OMD in
the liver, TA can be considered for small metastases
[III, B].
 TA is a valid treatment option for recurrent disease after
surgical resection for small CRLMs [II, B].
 In patients with lung-only metastases or OMD including
lung lesions, TA may be considered along with resection,
according to tumour size, number, location, the extent
of lung parenchyma loss, comorbidity or other factors
[III, B].
 SBRT is a treatment option, although it is yet unclear
which patients beneÔ¨Åt most [III, B].
Intra-arterial therapies
 TACE, TARE/SIRT and HAIC may be also considered as
treatment options with non-curative intent [III, B].
 SIRT, HAIC and chemoembolisation of CRLMs in earlier
treatment lines may be interesting as ‚Äòconsolidation
treatment‚Äô but should be limited to clinical trials [V, D].
MANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED AND METASTATIC DISEASE
WITHOUT POTENTIAL CONVERSION
An MDT discussion would be advisable to decide the best
treatment approach for each individual patient, taking into
consideration several factors that were established in the
2016 ESMO Consensus guideline (see Supplementary
Table S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.
2022.10.003), such as clinical presentation (impending
symptoms at diagnosis, PTL), histology and molecular
biology of the tumour, the patient characteristics (age, PS,
comorbidities, socioeconomic factors), the goal of

treatment and treatment-related issues [toxicity, quality of
life (QoL), etc.].94 When considering the best treatment
option for patients with mCRC, all of the above-mentioned
factors and medical history must be taken into
consideration.
Frail patients will not tolerate combination therapies with
potential side-effects. In these patients, the main treatment
goal is maintaining QoL and improving symptoms. These
patients could instead receive lower toxicity therapies, such
as Ô¨Çuoropyrimidine as monotherapy or combined with
bevacizumab, or anti-EGFR mAbs in left-sided RAS-wt tumours. The 2016 ESMO consensus guideline established
that the initial consideration for treatment stratiÔ¨Åcation was
whether patients were ‚ÄòÔ¨Åt‚Äô or ‚ÄòunÔ¨Åt‚Äô.94
Age alone is not a contraindication of combined therapy,
for a patient with good Ô¨Åtness, organ function and without
signiÔ¨Åcant comorbidities. A complete geriatric assessment
to consider all the factors that can affect treatment tolerance and compliance is advisable.95,96
Tumour characteristics are critical, for both prognosis
and predicted response to the available treatments. The
tumour burden, location of the metastases (involving one
or more organs) and the primary tumour, or impending
symptoms related to the primary tumour (haemorrhage
or intestinal obstruction), will guide the treatment
strategy.
The PTL and mutational status of the tumour is key to
decide the best treatment approach, as described above.
The location of the primary tumour proximal to the splenic
Ô¨Çexure also has prognostic implications, with a shorter
survival related both to the nature of the tumour, metastatic sites, and to a poor response to treatment with ChT
and mAbs. It must be stressed that those right colon tumours, in general, beneÔ¨Åt less in terms of PFS and OS from
treatment with anti-EGFR mAbs, compared with tumours
located distal to the splenic Ô¨Çexure.22 Nevertheless, RRs are
similar for both tumour locations.
The historical ESMO classiÔ¨Åcation of patients in four
groups according to the treatment goals has evolved (see
Supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2022.10.003).97 Treatment goals for Ô¨Åt patients differ according to different scenarios (see
Supplementary Table S5, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2022.10.003): (i) cure, generally achieved
through surgery, in those cases of OMD localised to liver,
lung and other solitary organs, (ii) to achieve a good
response and downstaging with ChT, allowing treatment
with curative intent in initially unresectable disease and (iii)
improving tumour-related symptoms, delaying progression
and prolonging survival in metastatic disease not amenable
to deÔ¨Ånitive surgical treatment or LTs despite response and
all while maintaining QoL. In the third group of patients, the
continuum of care concept demonstrates that sequencing
of all the different treatment options results in prolonged
disease control and improved survival.98 Liver transplantation is emerging as an experimental option for patients with CRLMs but results of randomised studies are still
pending.

First-line treatment
Proposed Ô¨Årst-line treatment strategies are shown in
Figure 2.
Cytotoxic agents. 5-FU is the backbone of mCRC treatment.
Most Ô¨Årst- and second-line clinical trials have explored
different combinations based on Ô¨Çuoropyrimidines, both i.v.
5-FU (as bolus or as continuous infusion, with a different
toxicity proÔ¨Åle) or oral capecitabine; these are considered
equivalent.99,100 S-1 (tegafuregimeracileoteracil) is an
alternative Ô¨Çuoropyrimidine when i.v. 5-FU or capecitabinebased ChT cannot be used due to cardiotoxicity and/or
hand-foot syndrome.101
The addition of oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan to a Ô¨Çuoropyrimidine improves RR and survival.102,103 Both doublets, FOLFOX and FOLFIRI, are considered to be equally

effective and the selection in the Ô¨Årst-line can be guided by
their different toxicity proÔ¨Åles and the biological added to
enhance efÔ¨Åcacy. Capecitabine is more frequently combined
with oxaliplatin (CAPOX) and less frequently with irinotecan
(CAPIRI) because CAPIRI has a more toxic proÔ¨Åle than
FOLFIRI.104 A dose-modiÔ¨Åed CAPIRI schedule showed a
more favourable toxicity proÔ¨Åle.105 The triplet FOLFOXIRI
has improved RRs and survival compared with FOLFIRI, but
side-effects limit its applicability to selected Ô¨Åt patients
without signiÔ¨Åcant comorbidities.45
Several trials have explored delivering treatment with
Ô¨Çuoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin and irinotecan either
sequentially or in combination in Ô¨Årst or later lines of
treatment, showing that both strategies achieved
similar OS.106-108 This observation conÔ¨Årmed that Ô¨Årstline treatment with a Ô¨Çuoropyrimidine, as a single

agent, is a reasonable option, particularly in frail
patients.
Biological targeted agents. Several targeted agents against
EGFR (cetuximab and panitumumab) or against the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway (bevacizumab
and ramucirumab, or the protein aÔ¨Çibercept) have
demonstrated improved outcomes when combined with
ChT, or as a monotherapy in the case of anti-EGFR mAbs.
Anti-EGFR. Two different anti-EGFR mAbs have demonstrated activity in mCRC as monotherapy or combined with
ChT. Cetuximab is a chimeric anti-EGFR mAb, which has
demonstrated effectiveness in different lines of treatment,
as has panitumumab, a humanised anti-EGFR mAb.109,110
Both treatments can produce characteristic skin toxicity,
which must be properly managed with antibiotics and
topical corticosteroids.111
The presence of RAS mutations is associated with resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs and knowing the expanded RAS
mutational status is mandatory for use of both cetuximab
and panitumumab, avoiding anti-EGFR mAb treatment
when a RAS mutation is conÔ¨Årmed.112,113
In the Ô¨Årst-line setting, FOLFIRIecetuximab was studied in a
non-selected population of mCRC patients.114 A retrospective
analysis demonstrated that only those patients without KRAS
exon 2 mutations had a signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced risk of disease
progression, improved OS and increased RR, compared with
those who received FOLFIRI alone, and a RAS expanded analysis conÔ¨Årmed the beneÔ¨Åt in RR and survival.115
A combination of FOLFOX with or without panitumumab
was similarly studied in an initially non-selected population
of mCRC, although analysis of the mutational status was
completed in >90% of the patients. In the KRAS-wt
population, a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant improvement in PFS
and OS was observed with FOLFOX4epanitumumab.116 An
expanded RAS analysis, including mutations in KRAS exons
2, 3 and 4, NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4 and BRAF V600E, also
conÔ¨Årmed the efÔ¨Åcacy of FOLFOXepanitumumab in the
RAS-wt population.112
Cetuximabeoxaliplatin in the Ô¨Årst-line setting was also
explored, showing a better RR and a trend toward an
improvement in PFS and OS in the RAS-wt population in a
randomised phase II study and better ORR, PFS and OS in a
Chinese phase III study.113,117
When a CAPOX combination was explored in addition to
cetuximab in the COIN trial, no signiÔ¨Åcant beneÔ¨Åt in terms
of PFS or OS was observed, with the exception of an
increased RR in the RAS-wt population treated with cetuximab.118 Moreover, the addition of cetuximab to
capecitabine-based therapy resulted in more diarrhoea and
skin toxicity, leading to a dose reduction/discontinuation of
the ChT schedule and a reduced exposure to Ô¨Çuoropyrimidines. Combination with anti-EGFR mAbecapecitabinebased ChT is not recommended. FLOX (LVebolus 5-FUe
oxaliplatin)ecetuximab also failed to show any beneÔ¨Åt.
Therefore, anti-EGFRebolus 5-FU-based ChT is not
recommended.119

Tumour location is an important factor when deciding the
use of anti-EGFR mAbs in RAS-wt tumours. As mentioned
previously, the beneÔ¨Åt of anti-EGFR mAbs is very relevant in
left-sided tumours, with a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in RR and
relevant prolongation of PFS and OS.22 In right-sided
tumours no beneÔ¨Åt is observed for PFS and OS by the
addition of cetuximab or panitumumab, except an increase
in RRs. For this reason, a doublet or a triplet with
bevacizumab is the preferred option for patients with
right-sided tumours independently of the RAS mutational
status. Only in right-sided RAS-wt tumours, in which a good
response is needed, i.e. for conversion therapy, a doublet
with an anti-EGFR mAb can be selected. In frail or elderly
patients, unable to tolerate ChT, whose tumours are
left-sided and RAS-wt, monotherapy with anti-EGFR mAbs
may be an option.120 Combination of anti-EGFR mAb with
ChT cannot be recommended in BRAF-mutant tumours.
Anti-VEGF. In the Ô¨Årst-line setting of mCRC, the only antiangiogenic that has shown better outcomes in combination
with ChT is bevacizumab, a selective VEGF-A inhibitor. This
antiangiogenic has characteristic class-related side-effects
including increase in blood pressure and proteinuria and,
less frequently, arterial thrombosis, and an increased risk of
bleeding, intestinal perforation and wound healing delay,
which can be decreased with proper patient selection.
There are currently no biomarkers to identify which patients
may beneÔ¨Åt more from this treatment.
The addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine increased
PFS compared with capecitabine monotherapy and this
beneÔ¨Åt on PFS was conÔ¨Årmed in patients 70 years old in
the AVEX phase III trial.121,122 No signiÔ¨Åcant differences in
OS were observed.
The addition of bevacizumab to an irinotecanebolus 5FUeLV (IFL) showed an improvement in OS, PFS and RR,
compared with IFLeplacebo.123 In the NO16966 phase III trial,
a 2  2 factorial design compared any Ô¨Çuoropyrimidinee
oxaliplatin combination (CAPOX or FOLFOX4) with or
without bevacizumab or placebo, showing an improvement in
outcome, limited to PFS.124
The TRICOLORE phase III trial compared mFOLFOX6 or
CAPOX and bevacizumab with irinotecaneS-1 (IRIS)ebevacizumab,125 concluding that IRISebevacizumab is noninferior to mFOLFOX6e or CAPOXebevacizumab with
respect to PFS, with comparable OS.126
Anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF strategy in RAS-wt mCRC patients.
To address which targeted therapy would offer the greatest
beneÔ¨Åt when combined with ChT in the Ô¨Årst-line setting,
the FIRE-3 trial compared FOLFIRIebevacizumab with
FOLFIRIecetuximab, in KRAS (exon 2)-wt mCRC. No differences in the primary endpoint of ORR or in PFS were
observed. However, an OS improvement was observed with
cetuximab. A post hoc analysis showed a signiÔ¨Åcant proportion of patients achieved a better objective response,
early tumour shrinkage and median depth of response in
the extended RAS-wt population receiving FOLFIRIe
cetuximab.43

A combined analysis of the FIRE-3 and CRYSTAL trials
conÔ¨Årmed the beneÔ¨Åt in OS on left-sided tumours treated
with FOLFIRIecetuximab.127
The CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial also compared cetuximab
with bevacizumab, in combination with an investigator‚Äôs
choice ChT doublet (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI), in KRAS (exon 2)wt mCRC. No differences in the primary endpoint of OS
were observed between the study arms, suggesting that
both treatment strategies were equally effective in the Ô¨Årstline setting on KRAS-wt mCRC. The expanded RAS analyses
showed no differences in OS or PFS but an increased RR
with cetuximab.44
A subsequent exploratory retrospective analysis of
CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial examined the impact of PTL. Patients with left-sided KRAS-wt tumours treated with cetuximab had an increased OS and PFS; conversely, patients
with right-sided tumours treated with bevacizumab had an
increased OS, conÔ¨Årming the limited beneÔ¨Åt of anti-EGFR
therapies on right-sided tumours.128
An exploratory phase II trial compared mFOLFOX6 with
panitumumab versus bevacizumab in patients with KRAS
exon 2-wt mCRC.129 The Ô¨Ånal results conÔ¨Årmed a beneÔ¨Åt in
PFS in the extended RAS-wt population treated with
FOLFOXepanitumumab, with no signiÔ¨Åcant differences in
OS.129 A phase III randomised trial (PARADIGM) comparing
both options resulted in a signiÔ¨Åcant beneÔ¨Åt in OS for the
FOLFOXepanitumumab arm in left-sided tumours, as well as
the whole population. The mOS was >36 months, conÔ¨Årming
the beneÔ¨Åt of this therapy in the Ô¨Årst-line setting, although
most of the beneÔ¨Åt is driven by left-sided tumours.130
Combining anti-VEGF plus anti-EGFR mAbs is not superior
to ChTeanti-VEGF alone in terms of PFS, OS and RR.
Furthermore, it increases grade 3 and 4 adverse event rates,
and is therefore not recommended.131
Triplets. The strategy of combining the three active ChT
agents 5-FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) has
been explored in mCRC, with the main purpose of
improving tumour shrinkage (shown by RR), thus allowing a
complete resection of metastases, but increasing potential
toxicities.107,132 A phase III trial showed increased RRs and
greater R0 resection rates of metastases with the triplet
among patients with CRLMs only (36% versus 12%).
Moreover, PFS and OS were both signiÔ¨Åcantly improved
with FOLFOXIRI. These Ô¨Åndings were not conÔ¨Årmed in a
similar Greek phase III trial, which included PS2 patients.132
The addition to bevacizumab in both arms of the TRIBE
phase III trial conÔ¨Årmed the higher efÔ¨Åcacy of triple ChT
backbone, with an improvement in PFS (median: 12.1
months in the tripletebevacizumab group and 9.7 months
with FOLFIRIebevacizumab) and in the ORR (65% versus
53%).46 Updated results conÔ¨Årmed a beneÔ¨Åt in mOS.133
Within molecular subtypes, the largest mOS was 37.1
months in the RAS and BRAF V600E-wt subgroup, while the
BRAF-mutated group had the shortest survival with 13.4
months. Since no prospective trial has included comparison
with an arm with FOLFOXIRI without bevacizumab, the
contribution of bevacizumab is considered uncertain.
20

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.10.003

The TRIBE2 phase III study compared an upfront triplet
(FOLFOXIRI) followed by a planned maintenance plus the
reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression, versus a sequence of mFOLFOX6 and FOLFIRI doublets,
each of the ChT regimens in combination with bevacizumab.
This approach favoured the triplet/maintenance/reintroduction strategy over sequential use for PFS2 (the interval
between randomisation and the date of second progression). No interaction was observed between treatment effect and RAS and BRAF V600E mutational status as shown
by the post hoc subgroup analyses of the TRIBE trial.134
Triplets including FOLFOXIRI should not be used in patients >75 years old, with PS2 or in patients with signiÔ¨Åcant
comorbidities. No phase III evidence supports the use of
anti-EGFR mAbs in combination with triplets, as shown in
the TRIPLETE trial,135 despite the initial beneÔ¨Åt in ORR in
the VOLFI phase II trial.136
First-line therapy in dMMR/MSI-H disease. The activity of
anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade
immunotherapy has been demonstrated on mCRC patients
with dMMR/MSI-H status. Phase II trials of nivolumab and
pembrolizumab, PD-1 ICIs, in dMMR/MSI-H mCRC patients
demonstrated beneÔ¨Åt in this small patient subgroup.137,138
In a pivotal phase III trial, 307 previously untreated
dMMR/MSI-H mCRC patients were randomised to receive
pembrolizumab (administered until progression or up to a
maximum of 2 years) or standard therapy (ChT plus targeted
agents, according to investigator‚Äôs choice). Pembrolizumab
demonstrated improvement in the primary endpoint of
PFS.12 Although no signiÔ¨Åcant differences in OS were
observed, this may be due to the high percentage of
crossover in the ChT arm (60% of patients progressing
received an ICI). Treatment-related adverse events of grade
3 occurred less frequently with pembrolizumab (22%),
compared with the ChT arm (66%). The QoL analysis also
favoured the use of pembrolizumab.139
Maintenance therapy
The concept of maintenance treatment has signiÔ¨Åcance for
patients with disease not amenable for surgery or LT (see
Figure 3). This describes de-escalation of treatment intensity,
resulting in improved side-effects and QoL, without relevantly
compromising therapeutic efÔ¨Åcacy and disease control. This
concept evolved from the need to limit the cumulative dose
of oxaliplatin cycles, with accumulative neurotoxicity; at that
point, the question arose of whether to maintain the
remainder or some of the drugs, or completely stop therapy.
Patient discussion is essential, explaining the beneÔ¨Åts and
risks of a maintenance approach.
Studies of maintenance strategies with continuation of
Ô¨Çuoropyrimidines after induction ChT, or a complete ChT-free
interval, showed contradictory results. In the MRC COIN trial,
a combination of continuous oxaliplatineÔ¨Çuoropyrimidine
was compared with the same treatment followed by a ChTfree interval until progressive disease.118,134 This trial failed
to show non-inferiority of the intermittent ChT approach. The
OPTIMOX1 trial suggested that a maintenance strategy with

Ô¨Çuoropyrimidines could be considered after induction ChT
with FOLFOX. However, the OPTIMOX2 trial explored short
induction FOLFOX7, followed by a maintenance strategy with
5-FUeLV or a ChT-free interval, conÔ¨Årming the negative
impact of the ChT-free interval on the median duration of
disease control and survival.140
The role of biologicals in maintenance strategies was
tested. Bevacizumab maintenance was explored after Ô¨Årstline induction ChTebevacizumab in the SAKK 41/06 and
PRODIGE 9 phase III trials showing no differences in disease
control duration, concluding that single-agent bevacizumab
has no meaningful therapeutic value.141,142 In the CAIRO3
study, maintenance treatment with capecitabinee
bevacizumab was compared with a complete break,
showing an improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS2.143
In the AIO 0207 trial, after Ô¨Årst-line induction with oxaliplatinbased ChTebevacizumab, patients were randomly assigned
to either maintenance with Ô¨Çuoropyrimidinesebevacizumab,
bevacizumab alone or observation. The primary endpoint was
to show non-inferiority for time to strategy failure with
bevacizumab alone compared with Ô¨Çuoropyrimidineebevacizumab.144 Its results support Ô¨Çuoropyrimidinee

bevacizumab as the preferable option. There are no phase
III data to support maintenance treatment with anti-EGFR
mAbs, although two phase II randomised trials have shown
that maintenance with 5-FUeanti-EGFR is better than 5-FU
or anti-EGFR alone.145,146
Second-line treatment
The beneÔ¨Åt of delivering second-line treatment to Ô¨Åt patients with no signiÔ¨Åcant comorbidities has been demonstrated in multiple trials. Proposed treatment strategies in
the second line are shown in Figure 4. The ChT backbone
depends mainly on the Ô¨Årst-line treatment received. With
Ô¨Årst-line oxaliplatin-based therapy, second-line treatment
with irinotecan with Ô¨Çuoropyrimidine or monotherapy
would be advisable. Conversely, those treated with Ô¨Årst-line
irinotecan-based could receive oxaliplatin-based treatment
(FOLFOX or CAPOX) in second line if no contraindications.
Anti-EGFR. The anti-EGFR mAbs cetuximab and panitumumab have demonstrated activity in the second-line (or

mCRC patients previously treated with oxaliplatin,
including the subgroup of patients previously treated
with bevacizumab.151
The RAISE phase III trial tested ramucirumab, a human
mAb that targets the extracellular domain of VEGF receptor
2, in combination with FOLFIRI in mCRC patients with disease progression during or after Ô¨Årst-line therapy with
bevacizumabeoxaliplatineÔ¨Çuoropyrimidines.152 A beneÔ¨Åt
in both OS and PFS was observed.
Each of these antiangiogenics in combination with ChT
has demonstrated improved OS in the second-line treatment of mCRC, irrespective of the Ô¨Årst-line treatment. In
case of RAS-mutated tumours with a rapid progression
while on bevacizumab Ô¨Årst-line treatment, second-line
therapy with ChT combined with aÔ¨Çibercept or ramucirumab could be considered, as those trials included patients
with a rapid progression while on Ô¨Årst-line treatment with
bevacizumab.
In RAS-wt patients treated upfront with bevacizumab,
second-line treatment with antiangiogenics or anti-EGFR
mAbs combined with ChT are good options. Treatment
with anti-EGFR mAbs can increase the RR, although the
beneÔ¨Åt is more extensive in left-sided tumours. In rightsided tumours a combination with ChT and an anti-VEGF
could be a better option. The side-effects proÔ¨Åle should
also be considered in this decision. In dMMR/MSI-H tumours progressing after Ô¨Årst-line ChT, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of ipilimumabe
nivolumab.153
BRAF V600E-mutated mCRC. As described, the presence of
BRAF mutations is associated with a poor prognosis in
mCRC, and current therapies have demonstrated less
effectiveness in these patients. New strategies blocking
the BRAF signalling pathway have shown preliminary activity.154,155 A phase III study in BRAF-mutant patients
progressing after Ô¨Årst- or second-line treatment tested the
combination of encorafenib (an oral BRAF V600E inhibitor), with binimetinib and cetuximab.156 Patients were
randomly assigned (1 : 1 : 1) to receive encorafenibe
cetuximab with or without binimetinib (doublet or
triplet) versus ChT (FOLFIRI or irinotecan) plus cetuximab.
OS was signiÔ¨Åcantly superior in the experimental arms,
either doublet or triplet, compared with standard of care.
The mOS was 9.3 months in the experimental arms and
5.9 months in the control group. A conÔ¨Årmed signiÔ¨Åcantly
better ORR was reported as 26.8% in the triplet arm,
19.5% in the doublet, versus 1.8% in the control group.
The QoL was not deteriorated in the experimental arm
and grade 3 adverse events reported were higher in the
standard arm (61%) compared with the doublet (50%) or
triplet treatment (58%). This study led to the approval of
encorafenibecetuximab for BRAF V600E pre-treated
mCRC; further studies are ongoing to test this combination in early phases of metastatic disease. Patients with
BRAF-mutant tumours and MSI-H status, who are
receiving Ô¨Årst-line immunotherapy, could also beneÔ¨Åt from
encorafenibecetuximab upon progression.

Third- and further-line treatment
Proposed treatment strategies for third and further lines are
shown in Figure 5.
Reintroduction of the initial induction therapy can be
considered after second-line therapy, in patients who did
not progress during the course of Ô¨Årst-line ChT.
Anti-EGFRs. Both cetuximab and panitumumab as single
agents have demonstrated activity in mCRC after previous
treatment with standard ChT. In comparison with best
supportive care (BSC), cetuximab monotherapy improved
OS and PFS, whilst preserving QoL with less deterioration in
physical function and global health status scores.110 Panitumumab was also compared with BSC in mCRC patients
who had been previously treated with standard ChT,
showing an increase in PFS and ORR. No difference in OS
was observed, probably due to crossover.109 This beneÔ¨Åt in
PFS as well as in OS was observed only in the KRAS-wt
population for both cetuximab and panitumumab.3,4 In
RAS-wt patients not previously treated with anti-EGFR
mAbs, in the third or further lines, a combination of
irinotecanecetuximab was superior to cetuximab monotherapy in ORR and PFS, but not in OS. Therefore, a combination of irinotecanecetuximab can be used in this
setting.157 Similarly, rechallenge with anti-EGFR mAbs has
shown initial good outcomes in RAS-wt patients according
to liquid biopsy testing in small non-randomised
studies.158,159
Regorafenib. Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that
demonstrated activity in refractory mCRC in a phase III
placebo-controlled trial, showing an increase in mOS and PFS
over BSC.160 Another phase III trial conÔ¨Årmed a beneÔ¨Åt on OS
with regorafenib in comparison with placebo. The most
common grade 3 adverse events were hand-foot syndrome,
hypertension, fatigue, diarrhoea, hyperbilirubinaemia,
increased liver enzymes and rash.161 This treatment could be
a possibility in Ô¨Åt patients with refractory disease after
standard ChT with 5-FUeirinotecaneoxaliplatin, with or
without anti-VEGF therapies or anti-EGFR mAbs.
TriÔ¨Çuridineetipiracil (TAS-102). TAS-102 is an oral agent
that combines triÔ¨Çuridine, a thymidine-based nucleoside
analogue, with tipiracil hydrochloride, a novel thymidine
phosphorylase inhibitor that improves the bioavailability of
triÔ¨Çuridine. TAS-102 has demonstrated improved PFS and
OS in refractory mCRC in a phase III trial.162 The most
frequently observed adverse events are neutropaenia and
leukopaenia and, much less frequently, febrile neutropaenia. A similar phase III trial conÔ¨Årmed a longer mOS
and a lower risk of death for those patients treated with
TAS-102 compared with placebo.163
HER2-positive mCRC. AmpliÔ¨Åcation of HER2 is a rare condition in mCRC. Therapies with HER2 blockade have shown
signiÔ¨Åcant antitumour activity: a dual blockade of HER2 with
a combination of trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 mAb and the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib, in a population of patients with KRAS exon 2-wt and HER2-positive mCRC

Recommendations
First-line therapy
 Determining the RAS mutational status on a tumour biopsy [I, A] (or through a liquid biopsy in case no tumour
sample is available [II, B]) is mandatory to guide the best
treatment decision.
 Delivering a biological therapy in combination with ChT
in the Ô¨Årst-line setting is recommended, unless contraindicated [I, A].
 In the majority of patients, Ô¨Årst-line treatment will
consist of a doublet of ChT (FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, CAPOX)
that can be combined with an anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR
mAb [I, B; for FOLFIRIecetuximab ESMO-Magnitude of

to increased side-effects and lack of efÔ¨Åcacy, combination with cetuximabecapecitabine or bolus 5-FU-based
ChT is not recommended [I, E].
In RAS-wt right-sided tumours, ChT  bevacizumab is the
preferred option [II, B]; although in cases in which a
higher response is needed for conversion therapy, a
doublet with cetuximab or panitumumab can be used
[II, C].
Anti-EGFR mAbs can be combined with the doublets
FOLFOX or FOLFIRI [I, A; FOLFOX4epanitumumab
ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4; modiÔ¨Åed FOLFOX6epanitumumab ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; for FOLFIRIecetuximab ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4].
Bevacizumab can be combined with single Ô¨Çuoropyrimidines, irinotecan or oxaliplatin-based doublet of ChT
(FOLFOX, CAPOX, FOLFIRI) or triplets (FOLOXIRI) [I, B].
Combining anti-VEGF plus anti-EGFR mAbs is not recommended [I, E].
A triplet with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab could also be
an option for selective patients with good PS and
without comorbidities [I, B; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2].
Triplets including FOLFOXIRI should not be used in patients >75 years old, with PS2 or in patients with significant comorbidities [IV, E].

a triplet (FOLFOXIRI), which can be combined with bevacizumab, should be considered, but a doublet plus bevacizumab could provide similar outcomes [II, B].
Triplets with FOLFOXIRI and anti-EGFR mAbs are not recommended [I, D].
In patients with comorbidities, older age or with metastatic disease not amenable to a curative treatment
strategy and no signiÔ¨Åcant disease-related symptoms,
monotherapy with a Ô¨Çuoropyrimidine  bevacizumab
can be used [I, B]. In frail or elderly patients unable to
tolerate ChT, whose tumours are left-sided and RAS-wt,
monotherapy with anti-EGFR mAbs can be considered
[IV, C].
In patients presenting with cardiotoxicity and/or handfoot syndrome on 5-FU or capecitabine-based ChT, S-1
may be used as an alternative [III, B].
Patients should receive all available treatments during
the course of the disease [I, B].
In dMMR/MSI-H mCRC patients, the ICI pembrolizumab
has demonstrated beneÔ¨Åt over standard ChT and targeted agents, in the Ô¨Årst-line setting and it is recommended as standard of care [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4;
ESCAT: I-A].

Maintenance therapy
 After Ô¨Årst-line therapy with ChT based on oxaliplatine
bevacizumab, maintenance therapy with a Ô¨Çuoropyrimidine and bevacizumab could be considered in nonprogressive patients after at least 4 months of treatment
[I, B].
 After Ô¨Årst-line therapy with ChT based on oxaliplatin plus
anti-EGFR mAbs, maintenance therapy with a Ô¨Çuoropyrimidine plus anti-EGFR mAbs could be considered in nonprogressive patients [II, B].
 When FOLFIRI is used in Ô¨Årst-line treatment, due to the
lack of a cumulative toxicity, we should continue irinotecan full therapy until progressive disease [V, B].
 Reintroduction of an initial successful induction therapy
should be done after progressive disease while on maintenance therapy [III, B].
Second-line treatment
 In patients treated with Ô¨Årst-line oxaliplatin-based therapy, second-line treatment with irinotecan-based or
monotherapy is recommended. On the contrary, those
patients treated with irinotecan-based in Ô¨Årst line could
receive an oxaliplatin-based treatment (FOLFOX or
CAPOX) in second line if no contraindications [II, A].
 In RAS-wt patients not previously treated with an antiEGFR mAb, treatment with ChT (FOLFIRI or irinotecan)
and cetuximab or panitumumab could be considered
for left-sided colon tumours [II, C]. For right-sided
tumours, second-line therapy with an anti-angiogenic
combined with ChT is recommended [II, B].
 In patients previously treated with irinotecaneÔ¨Çuoropyrimidine-based ChT alone, a combination of FOLFOXe
bevacizumab is recommended [I, A].

 A second-line treatment with an antiangiogenic combined with ChT, regardless of whether the Ô¨Årst-line treatment included bevacizumab or not, should be used,
independently of the RAS mutational status and the

 For dMMR/MSI-H tumours progressing after Ô¨Årst-line
ChT, ipilimumabenivolumab is recommended [III, B;
ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score 3].
Third- and further-line treatment
 Reintroduction of the initial induction therapy can be
considered after second-line therapy, as long as the patient did not progress during the induction course of
Ô¨Årst-line ChT [III, B].
 Regorafenib is recommended in patients pre-treated
with Ô¨Çuoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and biologics, if available, or in earlier lines of therapy following
oxaliplatin and irinotecan regimen failure, depending on
local approvals [I, A, ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 1].
 TriÔ¨Çuridineetipiracil is recommended in patients pretreated with Ô¨Çuoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan

FOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND
SURVIVORSHIP
The survivorship goals include physical evaluation and
management of the long-term toxicities related to surgery, LTs, ChT, targeted agents or immunotherapy. If the
patient is receiving an active treatment, radiological
evaluation should be carried out every 8-12 weeks,
including (in most cases) CT scan or MRI, as well as the
measurement of CEA levels. Patients with a radically
resected metastatic disease with potential for cure may
initially merit more intense monitoring with radiological
assessment with CT (or MRI) and measurement of CEA
levels every 3 months during the Ô¨Årst 2 years and every
6 months thereafter.19
Recommendations
 For patients receiving active treatment, radiological
evaluation should be carried out every 8-12 weeks,
including (in most cases) CT scan or MRI, as well as the
measurement of CEA levels [IV, B].
 Patients with a radically resected metastatic disease with
potential for cure merit more intense monitoring initially
with radiological assessment with CT (or MRI) and measurement of CEA levels every 3 months during the Ô¨Årst 2
years and every 6 months thereafter [I, A].
METHODOLOGY
This CPG was developed in accordance with the ESMO
standard operating procedures for CPG development
(https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-Meth
odology). The relevant literature has been selected by the
expert authors. A table of ESCAT scores is included in
Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2022.10.003. ESCAT scores have been
deÔ¨Åned by the authors and validated by the ESMO Translational Research and Precision Medicine Working Group.164
A table of ESMO-MCBS scores is included in Supplementary
Table S7, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.
