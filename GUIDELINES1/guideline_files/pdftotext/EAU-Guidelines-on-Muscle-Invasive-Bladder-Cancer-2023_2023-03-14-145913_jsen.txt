INTRODUCTION

1.1

Aims and scope

The European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines Panel for Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder
Cancer (MIBC) have prepared these guidelines to help urologists assess the evidence-based management of
MIBC and to incorporate guideline recommendations into their clinical practice.
Separate EAU guidelines are available addressing upper urinary tract (UUT) tumours [1], nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (TaT1 and carcinoma in situ) (NMIBC) [2], and primary urethral carcinomas [3].
It must be emphasised that clinical guidelines present the best evidence available to the experts
but following guideline recommendations will not necessarily result in the best outcome. Guidelines can never
replace clinical expertise when making treatment decisions for individual patients, but rather help to focus
decisions - also taking personal values and preferences/individual circumstances of patients into account.
Guidelines are not mandates and do not purport to be a legal standard of care.

1.2

Panel composition

The EAU Guidelines Panel consists of an international multidisciplinary group of clinicians, including urologists,
oncologists, a pathologist, a radiologist, radiotherapists and patient representatives.
Section 5.3 - MIBC and health status, was developed with the assistance of Prof.Dr. S. O’Hanlon,
consultant geriatrician, International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) representative and member of the
EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG Prostate Cancer Guidelines Panel. The MIBC Panel is most grateful for
his support.
All experts involved in the production of this document have submitted potential conflict of
interest statements which can be viewed on the EAU website Uroweb: https://uroweb.org/guideline/bladdercancermuscle-invasive-and-metastatic/?type=panel.

1.3

Available publications

A quick reference document (Pocket Guidelines) is available. This is an abridged version which may require
consultation together with the full text version.
Several scientific publications are available (the most recent paper dating back to 2021 [4], as are a
number of translations of all versions of the EAU MIBC Guidelines. All documents are accessible through the
EAU website: http://uroweb.org/guideline/bladder-cancer-muscle-invasive-and-metastatic/.

1.4

Publication history and summary of changes

1.4.1
Publication history
The EAU published its first guidelines on bladder cancer (BC) in 2000. This document covered both NMIBC
and MIBC. Since these conditions require different treatment strategies, it was decided to give each condition
its own guidelines, resulting in the first publication of separate MIBC Guidelines in 2004. This 2023 document
presents a limited update of the 2022 version.
1.4.2
Summary of changes
New relevant references have been identified through a structured assessment of the literature and
incorporated in the various chapters of the 2023 EAU MIBC Guidelines resulting in new sections added:
•
•
•

Section 5.2 Imaging for staging of MIBC, was restructured
Section 7.3 Radical cystectomy: technique and extent, was restructured
In Section 7.2.3 the following was added to the Summary of evidence
Summary of evidence and guidelines for pre- and post-operative radiotherapy
Summary of evidence
Limited evidence supports the safe use of pre- and post-operative radiotherapy in case a
neobladder is planned or in situ.

METHODS

2.1

Data identification

For the 2023 MIBC Guidelines, new and relevant evidence has been identified, collated and appraised through a
structured assessment of the literature. A broad and comprehensive literature search, covering all sections of the
MIBC Guideline was performed. The search was limited to English language publications. Databases searched
included Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Libraries, covering a time frame between June 11th, 2021 and
May 4th 2022. A total of 1,197 unique records were identified, retrieved and screened for relevance resulting
in 76 new publications having been included in the 2023 print. A detailed search strategy is available online:
https://uroweb.org/guideline/bladder-cancer-muscle-invasive-and-metastatic/?type=appendices-publications.
For each recommendation within the guidelines there is an accompanying online strength rating form which
includes the assessment of the benefit to harms ratio and patients‘ preferences for each recommendation.
The strength rating forms draw on the guiding principles of the GRADE methodology but do not purport to be

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

7

GRADE [5, 6]. These forms address a number of key elements namely:
1.
the overall quality of the evidence which exists for the recommendation, references used in
this text are grade according to a classification system modified from the Oxford Centre for
Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence [7];
2.
the magnitude of the effect (individual or combined effects);
3.
the certainty of the results (precision, consistency, heterogeneity and other statistical or
study related factors);
4.
the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes;
5.
the impact of patient values and preferences on the intervention;
6.
the certainty of those patient values and preferences.
These key elements are the basis which panels use to define the strength rating of each recommendation.
The strength of each recommendation is represented by the words ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ [8]. The strength of each
recommendation is determined by the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative
management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including certainty of estimates), and nature and variability
of patient values and preferences.
Additional information can be found in the general Methodology section of this print, and online at
the EAU website; http://www.uroweb.org/guideline/.
A list of Associations endorsing the EAU Guidelines can also be viewed online at the above address.
The results of a collaborative multi-stakeholder consensus project on the management of advanced- and
histological subtypes BC have been incorporated in the MIBC Guidelines update in 2020 [9, 10].

2.2

Future goals

Topics considered for inclusion in the 2024 update of the MIBC Guidelines:
•
Development of a diagnostic pathway for the assessment of visible and nonvisible haematuria;
•
Development of an evidence-based strategy for functional- and oncological follow-up of patients treated
for MIBC;
•
Participation in developing strategies to ensure meaningful participation of patients in the development
and implementation of the MIBC Guidelines.

EPIDEMIOLOGY, AETIOLOGY AND
PATHOLOGY

3.1

Epidemiology

Bladder cancer is the 7th most commonly diagnosed cancer in males, whilst it drops to 10th position when both
genders are considered [11]. The worldwide age-standardised incidence rate (per 100,000 person/years) is 9.5
for men and 2.4 for women [11]. In the European Union, the age-standardised incidence rate is 20 for men and
4.6 for women [11]. In Europe, the highest age-standardised incidence rate has been reported in Belgium (31 in
men and 6.2 in women) and the lowest in Finland (18.1 in men and 4.3 in women) [11].
Worldwide, the BC age-standardised mortality rate (per 100,000 person/years) was 3.3 for men
vs. 0.86 for women in 2012 [11]. Bladder cancer incidence and mortality rates vary across countries due to
differences in risk factors, detection and diagnostic practices, and availability of treatments. The variations
are, however, also partly caused by the different methodologies used in the studies and the quality of data
collection [12, 13]. The incidence and mortality of BC has decreased in some registries, possibly reflecting the
decreased impact of causative agents [14, 15].
Approximately 75% of patients with BC present with disease confined to the mucosa (stage Ta,
carcinoma in situ [CIS]) or submucosa (stage T1). In younger patients (< 40 years) this percentage is even
higher [16]. Patients with TaT1 and CIS have a high prevalence due to long-term survival in many cases and
lower risk of cancer-specific mortality (CSM) compared to T2-4 tumours [11, 12].

3.2

Aetiology

3.2.1
Tobacco smoking
Tobacco smoking is the most well-established risk factor for BC, causing 50–65% of male cases and 20–30%
of female cases [17, 18]. A causal relationship has been established between exposure to tobacco and cancer
in studies in which chance, bias and confounding can be discounted with reasonable confidence [19].

8

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

The incidence of BC is directly related to the duration of smoking and the number of cigarettes
smoked per day [20]. A meta-analysis looked at 216 observational studies on cigarette smoking and
cancer published between 1961 and 2003, and the pooled risk estimates for BC demonstrated a significant
association for both current and former smokers [21]. Recently, an increase in risk estimates for current
smokers relative to never smokers has been described suggesting this could be due to changes in cigarette
composition [17]. Starting to smoke at a younger age increased the risk of death from BC [22]. An immediate
decrease in the risk of BC was observed in those who stopped smoking. The reduction was about 40% within
one to four years of quitting smoking and 60% after 25 years of cessation [20]. Encouraging people to stop
smoking would result in the incidence of BC decreasing equally in men and women [17].
3.2.2
Occupational exposure to chemicals
Occupational exposure is the second-most important risk factor for BC. Work-related cases accounted
for 20–25% of all BC cases in several series and it is likely to occur in occupations in which dyes (with the
exception of hair dyes [23]), rubbers, textiles, paints, leathers, and chemicals are used [24, 25]. The risk of BC
due to occupational exposure to carcinogenic aromatic amines is significantly greater after ten years or more of
exposure; the mean latency period usually exceeds 30 years [26, 27]. Population-based studies established the
occupational attribution for BC in men to be 7.1%, while no such attribution was discernible for women [12, 28].
3.2.3
Radiotherapy
Increased rates of secondary bladder malignancies have been reported after external-beam radiotherapy
(EBRT) for gynaecological malignancies, with relative risks (RR) of 2–4 [25]. In a population-based cohort study,
the standardised incidence ratios for BC developing after radical prostatectomy (RP), EBRT, brachytherapy,
and EBRT-brachytherapy were 0.99, 1.42, 1.10, and 1.39, respectively, in comparison with the general U.S.
population [29].
It has recently been proposed that patients who have received radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer
with modern modalities such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) may have lower rates of in-field bladder- and
rectal secondary malignancies [30]. Nevertheless, since longer follow-up data are not yet available, and as BC
requires a long period to develop, patients treated with radiation and with a long life expectancy are at a higher
risk of developing BC [30].
3.2.4
Dietary factors
Several dietary factors have been related to BC; however, the links remain controversial. The European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study is an on-going multi-centre cohort study
designed to examine the association between diet, lifestyle, environmental factors and cancer. They found
no links between BC and fluid intake, red meat, vegetable and fruit consumption and only recently an inverse
association between dietary intake of flavonoids and lignans and the risk of aggressive BC tumours has been
described [31].
3.2.5
Metabolic disorders
In a large prospective study pooling six cohorts from Norway, Sweden, and Austria (The Metabolic syndrome
and Cancer project, Me-Can 2.0), metabolic aberrations, especially elevated blood pressure and triglycerides,
were associated with increased risks of BC among men, whereas high body mass index (BMI) was associated
with decreased BC risk. The associations between BMI, blood pressure and BC risk significantly differed
between men and women [32].
The association of diabetes mellitus (DM) with the risk of BC has been evaluated in numerous meta-analyses
with inconsistent results. When analysing specific subpopulations, DM was associated with BC or CSM risk
especially in men [33]. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are oral hypoglycaemic drugs used
for the management of type 2 DM. Their use and the association with BC is still a matter of debate. In a recent
meta-analysis of observational studies the summary results indicated that pioglitazone use was significantly
associated with an increased risk of BC which appears to be linked to higher dose and longer duration of
treatment [34]. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend that healthcare professionals should
not prescribe pioglitazone in patients with active BC [35]. Several countries in Europe have removed this agent
from the market or included warnings for prescription. Moreover, the benefits of glycaemic control vs. unknown
risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone should be considered in patients with a prior history of BC.
3.2.6
Bladder schistosomiasis and chronic urinary tract infection
Bladder schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is the second most common parasitic infection after malaria, with about
600 million people exposed to infection in Africa, Asia, South America, and the Caribbean [36]. There is a wellestablished relationship between schistosomiasis and urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder, which can

progress to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), however, better control of the disease is decreasing the incidence
of SCC of the bladder in endemic zones such as Egypt [37, 38].
Similarly, invasive SCC has been linked to the presence of chronic urinary tract infection (UTI)
distinct from schistosomiasis. A direct association between BC and UTIs has been observed in several casecontrol studies, which have reported a two-fold increased risk of BC in patients with recurrent UTIs in some
series [39]. However, a recent meta-analysis found no statistical association when pooling data from the
most recent and highest quality studies which highlights the need for better quality data to be able to draw
conclusions [40].
Similarly, urinary calculi and chronic irritation or inflammation of the urothelium have been described
as possible risk factors for BC. A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies suggests a positive
association between history of urinary calculi and BC [41].
3.2.7
Gender
Although men are more likely to develop BC than women, women present with more advanced disease and
have worse survival rates. A meta-analysis including nearly 28,000 patients shows that female gender was
associated with a worse survival outcome (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.09–1.32) compared to male
gender after radical cystectomy (RC) [42]. This finding had already been presented in a descriptive nationwide
analysis based on 27,773 Austrian patients. After their analysis the authors found that cancer-specific survival
(CSS) was identical for pT1-tumours in both sexes, while women had a worse CSS in both age cohorts (< 70
years and > 70 years) with higher tumour stages [43]. However, treatment patterns are unlikely to explain the
differences in overall survival (OS) [44]. In a population-based study from the Ontario Cancer Registry analysing
all patients with BC treated with cystectomy or radical RT between 1994 and 2008, no differences in OS,
mortality and outcomes were found between males and females following radical therapy [45]. The genderspecific difference in survival for patients with BC was also analysed in the Norwegian population. Survival
was inferior for female patients but only within the first 2 years after diagnosis. This discrepancy was partly
attributed to a more severe T-stage in female patients at initial diagnoses [46].
A population-based study from the MarketScan Databases suggests that a possible reason for
worse survival in the female population may be that women experienced longer delays in diagnosis than men,
as the differential diagnosis in women includes diseases that are more prevalent than BC [47]. Furthermore,
differences in the gender prevalence of BC may be due to other factors besides tobacco and chemical
exposure. In a large prospective cohort study, post-menopausal status was associated with an increase in
BC risk, even after adjustment for smoking status. This finding suggests that the differences in oestrogen
and androgen levels between men and women may be responsible for some of the difference in the gender
prevalence of BC [48-50]. Moreover, a recent population study assessing impact of hormones on BC suggests
that younger age at menopause (< 45 years) is associated with an increased risk of BC [51].
3.2.8
Genetic factors
There is growing evidence that genetic susceptibility factors and family association may influence the
incidence of BC. A recent population-based study of cancer risk in relatives and spouses of UC patients
showed an increased risk for first- and second-degree relatives, and suggests genetic or environmental
roots independent of smoking-related behaviour [52]. Shared environmental exposure was recognised as a
potentially confounding factor [53]. Recent studies detected genetic susceptibility with independent loci, which
are associated with BC risk [54].
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of BC identified several susceptibility loci associated
with BC risk [55, 56].
3.2.9

Summary of evidence and guidelines for epidemiology and risk factors

Summary of evidence
Worldwide, bladder cancer is the 10th most commonly diagnosed cancer.
Several risk factors associated with BC diagnosis have been identified.
Active and passive tobacco smoking continues to be the main risk factor, while exposure-related
incidence is decreasing.
The increased risk of developing BC in patients undergoing EBRT, brachytherapy, or a combination
of EBRT and brachytherapy, must be considered during patient follow-up. As BC requires time to
develop, patients treated with radiation at a young age are at the greatest risk and should be followedup closely.

Pathology

3.3.1
Handling of transurethral resection and cystectomy specimens
During transurethral resection (TUR), a specimen from the tumour and normal looking bladder wall should be
taken, if possible. Specimens should be taken from the superficial and deep areas of the tumour and sent to
the pathology laboratory separately, in case the outcome will impact on treatment decisions. If random biopsies
of the flat mucosa are taken, each biopsy specimen of the flat mucosa should be submitted separately [57]. The
sampling sites must be recorded by the urologist; the pathologist report should include location of tumour tissue
in the cystectomy specimen. Anatomical tumour location is relevant for staging and prognosis [58, 59].
In RC, bladder fixation must be carried out as soon as possible. The pathologist must open the
specimen from the urethra to the bladder dome and fix the specimen. In a female cystectomy specimen,
the length of the urethral segment removed en bloc with the specimen should be checked, preferably by the
urological surgeon [60].
Specimen handling should follow the general rules as published by a collaborative group of pathologists and
urologists [61, 62]. It must be stressed that it may be very difficult to confirm the presence of a neoplastic lesion
using gross examination of the cystectomy specimen after TUR or chemotherapy, so the entire retracted or
ulcerated area should be included and inked before fixation.
It is compulsory to study the urethra, the ureters, the prostate in men and the radial margins [63]. In
urethra-sparing cystectomy; the level of urethral dissection, completeness of the prostate, specifically at the
apex (in men), and the inclusion of the entire bladder neck and amount of adjacent urethra, uterus and vaginal
vault (in women) have to be documented by the pathologist.
All lymph node (LN) specimens should be provided in their totality, in clearly labelled containers to allow for
pTNM staging. In case of doubt or adipose differentiation of the LNs, the entire specimen is to be included.
Lymph nodes should be counted and measured on slides; capsular extension and percentage of LN invasion
should be reported as well as vascular embols [64, 65]. In case of metastatic spread in the perivesical fat
without real LN structures (capsule, subcapsular sinus), this localisation should nevertheless be considered as
N+. Potentially positive soft tissue margins should be inked by the pathologist for evaluation [66]. In rare cases,
fresh frozen sections may be helpful to determine treatment strategy [67].
3.3.2
Pathology of muscle-invasive bladder cancer
All MIBC cases are high-grade UCs. For this reason, no prognostic information can be provided by grading MIBC
[68]. Identification of morphological subtypes is important for prognostic reasons and treatment decisions [69-71].
The data presented in these guidelines are based on the 2004/2016 World Health Organization (WHO)
classifications [72, 73]. An update was presented in 2022 [74].
Currently the following subtypes of UC are used [74, 75]:
1.
urothelial carcinoma (more than 90% of cases);
2.
urothelial carcinomas with partial squamous and/or glandular or divergent differentiation;
3.
micropapillary UC;
4.
nested/microcystic variant;
5.
large nested variant;
6.
microtubular UC;
7.
plasmacytoid, signet ring;
8.
lymphoepithelioma-like;
9.
giant cell, diffuse, undifferentiated;
10. sarcomatoid UC;
11. some UCs with other rare differentiations;
12. urothelial carcinomas with partial NE (neuroendocrine differentiation, % to be given);
13. pure neuroendocrine carcinoma (including small and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas [Chapter NE
carcinomas in the genitourinary tract]).

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

In the new WHO 2022 all subtypes are considered HG [74]. The percentage of subtype in the specimen must
be reported since it has been shown to be of prognostic value [76]. The majority of subtypes are MIBC, with no
more than 15–30% being non-muscle invasive [76-83] (LE: 3).

pT3b or pT4a and pT4b).
Record margins with special attention paid to the radial margin, prostate, ureter, urethra,
peritoneal fat, uterus and vaginal vault.
Record the total number of lymph nodes (LNs), the number of positive LNs and extranodal
spread.
Record lymphovascular invasion.
Record the presence of carcinoma in situ.
Record the sampling sites as well as information on tumour size when providing specimens

STAGING AND CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS

Pathological staging

For staging, the Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) Classification (2017, 8th edition) is recommended [84]. Blood
and lymphatic vessel invasion have an independent prognostic significance [85, 86].

4.2

Tumour, node, metastasis classification

The TNM classification of malignant tumours is the method most widely used to classify the extent of cancer
spread [84] (Table 4.1).

DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

5.1

Primary diagnosis

5.1.1
Symptoms
Painless visible haematuria is the most common presenting complaint. Other presenting symptoms and clinical
signs include nonvisible haematuria, urgency, dysuria, increased frequency, and in more advanced tumours,
pelvic pain and symptoms related to urinary tract obstruction.
5.1.2
Physical examination
Physical examination should include rectal and vaginal bimanual palpation. A palpable pelvic mass can be
found in patients with locally-advanced tumours. In addition, bimanual examination under anaesthesia should
be carried out before and after TUR of the bladder tumour (TURBT) to assess whether there is a palpable mass
or if the tumour is fixed to the pelvic wall [90, 91]. However, considering the discrepancy between bimanual
examination and pT stage after cystectomy (11% clinical overstaging and 31% clinical understaging), bimanual
examination findings need to be interpreted with caution [92].
5.1.3
Bladder imaging
Patients with a bladder mass identified by any diagnostic imaging technique should undergo cystoscopy,
biopsy and/or resection for histopathological diagnosis and staging.
Due to the high specificity of diagnostic imaging for detecting BC, patients with imaging positive for BC
may avoid diagnostic flexible cystoscopy and go directly to rigid cystoscopy and transurethral resection [93, 94].

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

13

5.1.4
Urinary cytology
Examination of voided urine or bladder washings for exfoliated cancer cells has high sensitivity in high-grade
tumours and is a useful indicator in cases of high-grade malignancy or CIS. However, positive urinary cytology
may originate from a urothelial tumour located anywhere in the urinary tract.
Evaluation of cytology specimens can be hampered by low cellular yield, UTIs, stones or intravesical
instillations, but for experienced readers, specificity exceeds 90% [95, 96]. However, negative cytology does
not exclude a tumour. There is no known urinary marker specific for the diagnosis of invasive BC [97].
A standardised reporting system, the ‘Paris System’ redefining urinary cytology diagnostic categories has been
updated in 2022 [98]:
•
adequacy of urine specimens (Adequacy);
•
negative for high-grade UC (Negative);
•
atypical urothelial cells (AUC);
•
suspicious for high-grade UC (Suspicious);
•
high-grade UC (HGUC).
5.1.5
Cystoscopy
Ultimately, the diagnosis of BC is made by cystoscopy and histological evaluation of resected tissue. An
(outpatient) flexible cystoscopy is recommended to obtain a complete image of the bladder. However, in
daily practice, If a bladder tumour has been visualised unequivocally by imaging studies such as computed
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US), diagnostic cystoscopy may be
omitted and the patient can proceed directly to TURB for histological diagnosis and resection. During the
procedure, a thorough investigation of the bladder with rigid cystoscopy under anaesthesia is mandatory in
order not to miss any tumours at the level of the bladder neck. Currently, there is no evidence for the role of
photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) in the standard diagnosis of invasive BC.
A careful description of the cystoscopic findings is necessary. This should include documentation
of the site, size, number, and appearance (papillary or solid) of the tumours, as well as a description of any
mucosal abnormalities [99]. The use of a bladder diagram is recommended.
The use of PDD could be considered if a T1 high-grade tumour is present and to identify associated
CIS. Presence of CIS may lead to a modified treatment plan (see EAU Guidelines on Non-muscle-invasive
Bladder Cancer [2]). Photodynamic diagnosis is highly sensitive for the detection of CIS and in experienced
hands the rate of false-positive results may be similar to that with regular white-light cystoscopy [86, 100].
5.1.6
Transurethral resection of invasive bladder tumours
The goal of TURB is to enable histopathological diagnosis and staging, which requires the inclusion of bladder
muscle in the resection specimen.
In case MIBC is suspected, tumours need to be resected separately in parts, which include the
exophytic part of the tumour, the underlying bladder wall with the detrusor muscle, and the edges of the
resection area. At least the deeper part of the resection specimen must be referred to the pathologist in a
separate labelled container to enable making a correct diagnosis. In cases in which RT is considered and CIS is
to be excluded, PDD can be used [101].
The involvement of the prostatic urethra and ducts in men with bladder tumours has been
reported. The exact risk is not known, but it seems to be higher if the tumour is located on the trigone or
bladder neck, with concomitant bladder CIS, and in the case of multiple tumours [59, 102, 103]. Involvement
of the prostatic urethra can be determined either at the time of primary TURB or by frozen section during the
cystoprostatectomy procedure. A frozen section has a higher negative-predictive value and is more accurate
[104-106].
A negative urethral frozen section can reliably identify patients in whom urethrectomy should be avoided.
However, a positive pre-operative biopsy seems to have limited utility as these findings are not reliably
associated with final margin status [104, 107].
Diagnosis of a urethral tumour before cystectomy will result in a urethrectomy which could be a
contraindication for an orthotopic diversion. However, an orthotopic diversion should not be denied based
on positive pre-operative biopsy findings alone and frozen section should be part of the RC procedure, in
particular in male patients [108, 109].

5.1.7

Summary of evidence and guidelines for the primary assessment of presumably invasive
bladder tumours

Summary of evidence
Cystoscopy is necessary for the diagnosis of bladder cancer.
Urinary cytology has high sensitivity in high-grade tumours including carcinoma in situ.
In men, prostatic urethral biopsy includes resection from the bladder neck to the verumontanum
(between the 5 and 7 o’clock position) using a resection loop. In case any abnormal-looking areas in
the prostatic urethra are present at this time, these need to be biopsied as well.

Recommendations
Describe all macroscopic features of the tumour (site, size, number and appearance) and
mucosal abnormalities during cystoscopy. Use a bladder diagram.
Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder neck tumour, when bladder
carcinoma in situ is present or suspected, when there is positive cytology without evidence
of tumour in the bladder, or when abnormalities of the prostatic urethra are visible.
In men with a negative prostatic urethral biopsy undergoing subsequent orthotopic
neobladder construction, an intra-operative frozen section can be omitted.
In men with a prior positive transurethral prostatic biopsy, subsequent orthotopic
neobladder construction should not be denied a priori, unless an intra-operative frozen
section of the distal urethral stump reveals malignancy at the level of urethral dissection.
In women undergoing subsequent orthotopic neobladder construction, obtain procedural
information (including histological evaluation) of the bladder neck and urethral margin, either
prior to, or at the time of cystectomy.
In the pathology report, specify the grade, depth of tumour invasion, and whether the
lamina propria and muscle tissue are present in the specimen.

Imaging for staging of MIBC

In clinical practice, tumour stage and histopathological grade are used to guide treatment and determine
prognosis [110-112]. Imaging is essential for local- and distant staging of BC.
The goal of imaging patients with BC is to:
•
Detect bladder tumours;
•
Differentiate T1 from T2 tumours as their treatment will differ;
•
Evaluate the extent of locally-advanced tumour stage or tumour spread to LNs;
•
Assess tumour spread to the upper UT or other distant organs (e.g., liver, lungs, bones, peritoneum,
pleura, and adrenal glands).

5.2.1
Detection
Imaging modalities used to detect bladder tumours are: US, CT and MRI-scan. Bladder tumours are often
detected as part of the haematuria work-up (including cystoscopy) or as an incidental finding on imaging.
Ultrasound can visualize intraluminal masses in the bladder and additional signs such as hydronephrosis, but
cannot rule out all possible causes of haematuria. According to the results of the DETECT I trial, CT urogram
can be safely replaced by renal and bladder US in patients who have nonvisible haematuria [113].
5.2.2
Local staging of the bladder and upper tract
5.2.2.1
Magnetic resonance imaging for local staging of MIBC
Differentiation between NMIBC and MIBC is crucial for BC treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging has superior
soft tissue contrast resolution compared with CT and can evaluate post-biopsy reaction as enhancement of the
tumour occurs earlier than that of the normal bladder wall due to neovascularisation [114, 115].
The accuracy of MRI for primary tumour staging ranges from 73% to 96% (mean 85%). Huang
et al., in a systematic review, showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.88, respectively, with
results increasing to 0.92 and 0.96 when a 3T scan was used, with diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI as part of the
acquisition protocol [116].
A systematic review evaluating 20 studies (n = 1,724), showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of MRI
for differentiating between stages < T1 and > T2 of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88–0.95) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.78–0.94),
respectively [117]. More recently, multiparametric (mp)MRI using the VI-RADS scoring system has been
introduced to differentiate between T1 vs. T2 bladder tumours with a high diagnostic accuracy [118]. The
VI-RADS offers a standardised approach to both acquisition and reporting of mpMRI for BC; however, the
best practice of using mpMRI in this setting and the exact cut-off levels for VI-RADS scoring still need to be
determined [115]. To date, the VI-RADS score has been validated by several research groups, showing good
diagnostic performance in detecting MIBC [119, 120]. Also, a high diagnostic performance for the detection of
muscle invasion of urothelial carcinoma subtypes was found [121].
VI-RADS assessment scoring proved to be an independent predictor of muscle-invasiveness, which might
implicate a shift toward a more aggressive selection approach of patients at high risk of MIBC, according to a
novel proposed predictive pathway [122].
A meta-analysis found that the pooled sensitivity and specificity of mpMRI with VI-RADS acquisition and
scoring for predicting MIBC were 0.83 and 0.90, respectively. The diagnostic performance of using VI-RADS
scoring is similar to the diagnostic performance of a conventional bladder MRI in determining MIBC based on
a previous meta-analysis of 24 studies [123]. The analysis found substantial inter-reader agreement, with kappa
(κ) values ranging from 0.81 to 0.92 [123]. A systematic review and meta-analysis (n = 1,016) showed a pooled
weighted mean κ estimate of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78–0.88) [124]. The potential role of mpMRI as first-line test for
local staging of BC rather than TURB has been demonstrated in a recent clinical trial [125].
Considering the link established between the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents and nephrogenic
systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with impaired renal function, contrast medium should be managed according
to the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) Guidelines [126]. Interest is growing on the role of noncontrast MRI for the assessment of MIBC using VI-RADS with promising results [127].
5.2.2.2
CT imaging for local staging of MIBC
General advantages of CT imaging include high spatial resolution, shorter acquisition time, wider coverage in
a single breath hold, and lower susceptibility to variable patient factors. Computed tomography is unable to
differentiate between stages Ta to T3a tumours, but it is useful for detecting invasion into the perivesical fat
(T3b) and adjacent organs. The accuracy of CT in determining extravesical tumour extension varies from 55%
to 92% [128] and increases with more advanced disease [129].
Both CT and MRI may be used for assessment of local invasion by T3b disease, or higher, but they
are unable to accurately diagnose microscopic invasion of perivesical fat (T2 vs. T3a) [130]. Contrast-enhanced
CT using iodinated contrast media can be considered as an alternative to MRI when MRI is contraindicated or
not available [131].
5.2.2.3
Computed tomography urography for local staging of the upper tract
For local staging of the UUT, CTU has the highest diagnostic accuracy of the available imaging techniques
[132]. The sensitivity of CTU for UTUC is 0.67–1.0 and specificity is 0.93–0.99 [133].
Rapid acquisition of thin sections allows high-resolution isotropic images that can be viewed in
multiple planes to assist with diagnosis without loss of resolution. Epithelial ‘flat lesions’ without mass effect or
16

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

urothelial thickening are generally not visible with CT. The secondary sign of hydronephrosis is associated with
advanced disease and poor oncological outcome [134, 135]. The presence of enlarged LNs is highly predictive
of metastases in UTUC [136].
5.2.2.4
Magnetic resonance urography for local staging of the upper tract
Magnetic resonance urography is indicated in patients who cannot undergo CTU, usually when radiation or
iodinated contrast media are contraindicated [137]. The sensitivity of MR-urography is 0.75 after contrast
injection for tumours < 2 cm [137]. The use of MR-urography with gadolinium-based contrast media should be
limited in patients with severe renal impairment (< 30 mL/min creatinine clearance), due to the risk of NSF.
Computed tomography urography is generally preferred to MR-urography for diagnosing and
staging UTUC.
5.2.3
Distant staging of lymph nodes and other sites
5.2.3.1
Imaging of lymph nodes in MIBC
Assessment of LN metastases based on size alone is limited; both CT and MRI are unable to identify
metastases in normal-sized or minimally-enlarged nodes. The sensitivity of these modalities for detection of LN
metastases is low (48–87%). Specificity is also low because nodal enlargement may be due to benign disease.
Overall, CT and MRI show similar results in the detection of LN metastases in a variety of primary pelvic
tumours [138-142]. Pelvic nodes > 8 mm and abdominal nodes > 10 mm in maximum short-axis diameter,
detected by CT or MRI, should be regarded as pathologically enlarged [143, 144]. In a recent paper including
1,104 patients, conventional cross-sectional imaging showed slight concordance (64.9%) between cN and pN
stages (sensitivity: 30%; specificity: 84%) [145].
18F-fluorodeoxy glucose-Positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) combined with CT is
increasingly being used in clinical practice but its exact role still needs to be further evaluated [146, 147].
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis including 785 patients, FDG-PET/CT showed a low
sensitivity and high specificity for the detection of metastatic LNs in patients with newly diagnosed BC [148].
However, most studies evaluating FDG-PET/CT for LN assessment reported higher sensitivity than CT, with
comparable specificity [149]. PET/CT can provide additional information to guide local treatment in case of
presence of pelvic nodes metastases [150].
However, in a clinical trial the role of PET/CT was assessed in evaluating LN involvement in patients receiving
neoadjuvant pembrolizumab. The performance of PET/CT did not justify its routine use in cN0 MIBC patients,
but proved useful in optimising selection of MIBC patients suited for neoadjuvant immunotherapy (IO) strategies
in a clinical trial setting [151].
5.2.3.2
Distant metastases
Prior to any curative treatment, it is essential to evaluate the presence of distant metastases. Computed
tomography and MRI are the diagnostic techniques of choice to detect e.g., lung- [152] and liver metastases
[153], respectively.
Evidence for the role of FDG-PET/CT for staging distant metastases of MIBC is still limited. In a
recent series of 711 patients, FDG-PET/CT has shown to provide important staging information through the
detection of distant metastases, which may impact the clinical management of MIBC patients [150].
Bone and brain metastases are rare at the time of presentation of invasive BC. In a recent
retrospective, large sample, study bone scan has showed to have an impact on patients’ intended
management in only 19 out of 1,148 (1.7%) patients, therefore it should not be routinely used [154]. Wholebody MRI is more sensitive and specific for diagnosing bone metastases than bone scintigraphy [155]. Also,
additional brain imaging is not routinely indicated unless the patient has specific symptoms or signs to suggest
brain metastases.
5.2.4
Response to therapy
Pre-operative MRI in different settings may provide useful information regarding treatment response. In the
neoadjuvant setting, the first study evaluating the performance of MRI in assessing therapeutic response
to induction chemotherapy showed superiority of DWI over T2-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced
(DCE)-MRI [156]. The high specificity of DWI indicates that it is useful for accurate prediction of a
complete histopathological response, allowing better patient selection for bladder-sparing protocols [157].
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging has shown to potentially predict whether a patient will respond to
chemotherapy after two cycles [158]. In addition, quantitative DWI/MRI analysis has shown to provide an
accurate and non-invasive assessment of bladder RT response. However, multi-centre validation is required
before prospective testing to inform MIBC RT follow-up schedules and decision making [159].
The performance of PET/CT in evaluating LN involvement in patients receiving neoadjuvant
pembrolizumab did not justify its routine use in cN0 MIBC patients [151].

Future perspectives
Potential future application of the VI-RADS score may include prediction of therapy response as well as
peri-operative outcomes using its modified version: the NAC VI-RADS (nacVI-RADS), however, prospective
evidence is warranted [160].
Future trends might include image analysis radiomic-based techniques in predicting MIBC. A metaanalysis (n = 860) provided summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity in predicting MIBC of 82% (95%
CI: 77–86%) and 81% (95% CI: 76–85%), respectively [161].
PET/MRI combining the benefits of MRI with functional imaging could be evisioned for the detection
of metastatic BC lesions not seen on CT in patients that cannot receive intravenous iodine contrast, and may
lead to improved treatment planning and monitoring for BC [162].
Among the novel approaches and radiotracers, in a pilot study, Rietbergen et al., showed that the sentinel
node (SN) biopsy in bladder cancer using the hybrid tracer ICG- 99mTc-nanocolloid is feasible, and in patients
with a successful pre-operative SN mapping using lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT, the intraoperative
SN guidance and detection are effective, even outside the extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND)
area [163].
5.2.6

Summary of evidence and guidelines for staging in muscle-invasive bladder cancer

Summary of evidence
Imaging as part of staging in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) provides information about
prognosis and assists in selection of the most appropriate treatment.
The diagnosis of upper tract UC depends on CT urography and, if needed, ureteroscopy.
In local staging, MRI is superior to CT in terms of differentiating T1 from T2 disease.
Bone scintigraphy has limited value in the staging of invasive BC.
FDG-PET/CT can provide additional information to guide treatment.
Recommendations
In patients with confirmed muscle-invasive bladder cancer, use computed tomography (CT)
of the chest, abdomen and pelvis for staging, including some form of CT urography with
designated phases for optimal urothelial evaluation.
Use CT urography, unless it is contraindicated for reasons related to contrast adminstration
or radiation dose; in that case use magnetic resonance imaging.

Muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer and health status

Complications from RC may be directly related to pre-existing comorbidity as well as the surgical procedure,
bowel anastomosis, or urinary diversion. A significant body of literature has evaluated the usefulness of age
as a prognostic factor for RC, although chronological age is less important than frailty [164-166]. Frailty is a
syndrome of reduced ability to respond to stressors. Patients with frailty have a higher risk of mortality and
negative side effects of cancer treatment [167]. Controversy remains regarding age, RC and the type of urinary
diversion. Radical cystectomy is associated with the greatest risk reduction in disease-related and nondisease-related death in patients aged < 80 years [168].
The largest retrospective study on RC in septuagenarians and octogenarians based on data from
the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (n = 1,710) showed no significant difference
for wound, cardiac, or pulmonary complications. However, the risk of mortality in octogenarians compared
to septuagenarians is higher (4.3% vs. 2.3%) [169]. Although some octogenarians successfully underwent a
neobladder procedure, most patients were treated with an ileal conduit diversion. It is important to evaluate
functioning and quality of life (QoL) of older patients using a standardised geriatric assessment, as well as
carrying out a standard medical evaluation [170].
Sarcopenia has been shown to be an independent predictor for OS and CSS in a large multi-centre study with
patients undergoing RC for BC [171]. In order to predict CSM after RC in patients receiving NAC, sarcopenia
should be assessed after completing chemotherapy [172]. Other risk factors for morbidity include prior
abdominal surgery, extravesical disease, and prior RT [173]. Female gender, an increased BMI and lower
pre-operative albumin levels are associated with a higher rate of parastomal hernias [174]. Low pre-operative
serum albumin is also associated with impaired wound healing, gastrointestinal (GI) complications and a
decrease of recurrence-free and OS after RC [175, 176]. Therefore, it could be used as a prognostic biomarker
for patients undergoing RC.

5.3.1
Evaluation of comorbidity, frailty and cognition
Rochon et al., have shown that evaluation of comorbidity provides a better indicator of life expectancy in MIBC
than patient age [177]. Evaluation of comorbidity helps to identify factors likely to interfere with, or have an
impact on, treatment and the evolution and prognosis of MIBC [178].
The value of assessing overall health before recommending and proceeding with surgery was
emphasised by Zietman et al., who have demonstrated an association between comorbidity and adverse
pathological and survival outcomes following RC [179]. Similar results were found for the impact of comorbidity
on cancer-specific and other-cause mortality in a population-based competing risk analysis of > 11,260
patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. Age carried the highest risk for
other-cause mortality but not for increased cancer-specific death, while the stage of locally-advanced tumour
was the strongest predictor for decreased CSS [180].
Stratifying older patients according to frailty using a multidisciplinary approach will help select
patients most likely to benefit from radical surgery and to optimise treatment outcomes [181]. There are many
different screening tools available for frailty and local approaches can be used. Examples include the G8 and
the Clinical Frailty Scale (See Table 5.2 and Figure 5.1 below).
Cognitive impairment can be screened for by using a tool such as the mini-COG (https://mini-cog.
com/), which consists of three-word recall and a clock-drawing test, and can be completed within 5 minutes.
A score of < 3/5 indicates the need to refer the patient for full cognitive assessment. Patients with any form of
cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer’s or vascular dementia) may need a capacity assessment of their ability
to make an informed decision, which is an important factor in health status assessment. Cognitive impairment
also predicts risk of delirium, which is important for patients undergoing surgery [182].

5.3.2
Comorbidity scales, anaesthetic risk classification and geriatric assessment
A range of comorbidity scales has been developed [185], seven of which have been validated [186-192]. The
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) ranges from 0 to 30 according to the importance of comorbidity described
at four levels and is calculated by healthcare practitioners based on patients’ medical records. The score has
been widely studied in patients with BC and found to be an independent prognostic factor for peri-operative
mortality [193, 194], overall mortality [195], and CSM [168, 196-198]. Only the age-adjusted version of the CCI
was correlated with both cancer-specific and other-cause mortality [199]. The age-adjusted CCI (Table 5.3) is the
most widely used comorbidity index in cancer for estimating long-term survival and is easily calculated [200].
Health assessment of oncology patients must be supplemented by measuring their activity level.
Extermann et al., have shown that there is no correlation between morbidity and competitive activity level [201].
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) scores and Karnofsky index have
been validated to measure patient activity [202]. Performance score is correlated with patient OS after RC [197]
and palliative chemotherapy [203-205].
Patients who have screened positive for frailty or cognitive impairment benefit from an assessment by a
geriatrician. This allows identification of geriatric syndromes and any scope for optimisation. The most
complete protocol is the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) [206] which is useful in the care of cancer
patients [207]. In BC, the CGA has been used to adapt gemcitabine chemotherapy in previously untreated older
patients with advanced BC [208].

Chronological age is of limited relevance.
It is important to screen for frailty and cognitive impairment and provide a Comprehensive Geriatric
Assessment (CGA) where optimisation is needed.

Recommendations
Base the decision on bladder-sparing treatment or radical cystectomy in older/frail patients
with invasive bladder cancer on tumour stage and frailty.
Assess comorbidity by a validated score, such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index.
The American Society of Anesthesiologists score should not be used in this setting

Introduction

Both patient and tumour characteristics guide treatment decisions and prognosis of patients with MIBC.

6.2

Prognostic markers

6.2.1
Histopathological and clinical markers
The most important histopathological prognostic variables after RC and LN dissection are tumour stage and
LN status [209]. In addition, other histopathological parameters of the RC specimen have been associated with
prognosis.
The value of lymphovascular invasion was reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis
including 78,000 patients from 65 studies treated with RC for BC [210]. Lymphovascular invasion was present
in 35% of the patients and correlated with a 1.5-fold higher risk of recurrence and CSM, independent of
pathological stage and peri-operative chemotherapy. This correlation was even stronger in those patients with
node-negative disease [211].
In a systematic review and meta-analysis including 23 studies and over 20,000 patients, the
presence of concomitant CIS in the RC specimen was associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) of ureteral
involvement (pooled OR: 4.51, 2.59–7.84). Concomitant CIS was not independently associated with OS,
recurrence-free survival (RFS) and DSS in all patients, but in patients with organ-confined disease concomitant
CIS was associated with worse RFS (pooled HR: 1.57, 1.12–2.21) and CSM (pooled HR: 1.51, 1.001–2.280) [211].
Tumour location has been associated with prognosis. Tumours located at the bladder neck or trigone of the
bladder appear to have an increased likelihood of nodal metastasis (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.11–2.99) and have
been associated with decreased survival [209, 212-214].
Prostatic urethral involvement at the time of RC was also found to be associated with worse survival
outcomes. In a series of 995 patients, prostatic involvement was recorded in 31% of patients. The 5-year CSS
in patients with CIS of the prostatic urethra was 40%, whilst the prognosis of patients with UC invading the
prostatic stroma was worse with a 5-year CSS of only 12% [215].
Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has emerged as a prognostic factor in UUT tumours [1] and
other non-urological malignancies. In a pooled analysis of 21 studies analysing the prognostic role of NLR in
BC, the authors correlated elevated pre-treatment NLR with OS, RFS and disease-free survival (DFS) in both
localised and metastatic disease [216]. In contrast, a secondary analysis of the Southwest Oncology Group
(SWOG) 8710 trial, a randomised phase III trial assessing cystectomy ± NAC in patients with MIBC, suggests
that NLR is neither a prognostic nor a predictive biomarker for OS in MIBC [217].
In patients with LN-positive disease, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)-TNM staging system
provides 3 subcategories. In addition, several other prognostic LN-related parameters have been reported.
These include, but are not limited to, the number of positive LNs, the number of LNs removed, LN density
(the ratio of positive LNs to the number of LNs removed) and extranodal extension. In a systematic review
and meta-analysis, it was reported that LN density was independently associated with OS (HR: 1.45, 95%,
CI: 1.11–1.90) [218]. It has been suggested that LN density outperforms the AJCC-TNM staging system for
LN-positive disease in terms of prognostic value [219, 220]. However, in spite of these studies supporting the
use of LN density, LN density relies on the number of LNs removed which, in turn, is subject to surgical and
pathological factors. This makes the concept of LN density difficult to apply uniformly [221].
Two studies investigated whether any of the reported LN-related parameters may be superior to the
routinely used AJCC-TNM staging system [221, 222]. Whilst the conclusion was that the AJCC-TNM staging
system for LN status did not perform well, none of the other tested variables outperformed the AJCC system.
6.2.2
Molecular markers
6.2.2.1
Molecular subtypes based on the Cancer Genome Atlas cohort
The updated Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reported on 412 MIBCs and identified two main groups; luminal
and basal-squamous - consisting of five mRNA expression-based molecular subtypes including luminalpapillary, luminal-infiltrated, luminal; basal-squamous; and neuronal; a subtype associated with poor survival in
which the majority of tumours do not have small cell or neuroendocrine histology. Each subtype is associated
with distinct mutational profiles, histopathological features and prognostic and treatment implications [223].
The basal-squamous subtype is characterised by expression of basal keratin markers, immune
infiltrates and is felt to be chemosensitive. The different luminal subtypes are characterised by fibroblast
growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) alterations (luminal-papillary [LumP]), epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) markers (luminal-infiltrated) and may be associated with chemotherapy resistance [70, 71, 223, 224].
In 2019, a consensus on molecular subtype classification reported [225]. The authors analysed 1,750 MIBC

22

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

transcriptomic profiles from 18 datasets and identified six MIBC molecular classes that reconcile all previously
published classification schemes. The molecular subgroup classes include LumP, luminal non-specified
(LumNS), luminal unstable (LumU), stroma-rich, basal/squamous (Ba/Sq), and neuroendocrine-like (NE-like).
Each class has distinct differentiation patterns, oncogenic mechanisms, tumour micro-environments and
histological and clinical associations. However, the authors stressed that consensus was reached for biological
rather than clinical classes. Therefore, at this time, the classification should be considered as a research tool
for retrospective and prospective studies until future studies establish how these molecular subgroups can be
used best in a clinical setting.
Molecular classification of MIBC is still evolving and treatment tailored to molecular subtype is
not a standard yet. A novel 12-gene signature derived from patients in the TCGA utilising published gene
signatures has been developed and externally validated to predict OS in MIBC [226]. Interestingly, a recently
published analysis of molecular subtyping in MIBC demonstrated that although molecular subtypes reflect the
heterogeneity of bladder tumours and are associated with tumour grade, clinical parameters outperformed
subtypes for predicting outcome [227]. In the coming years, new insights into BC carcinogenesis may change
our management of the disease and our ability to better predict outcomes [228]. Outside clinical trials,
molecular subtyping, either by expression profiling or immunohistochemistry, is not yet part of routine clinical
work-up awaiting more conclusive data.

6.3

Predictive markers

6.3.1
Clinical and histopathological markers
Based on retrospective data only, patients with secondary MIBC have a worse response to NAC compared
to patients with primary MIBC [229]. Pietzak et al., retrospectively analysed clinico-pathologic outcomes
comparing 245 patients with clinical T2–4a N0M0 primary MIBC and 43 patients with secondary MIBC
treated with NAC and RC. They found that patients with secondary MIBC had lower pathologic response
rates following NAC than those with primary MIBC (univariable 26% vs. 45%, multivariable OR: 0.4 [95%
CI: 0.18–0.84, p = 0.02]). They also found that MIBC patients progressing after NAC had worse CSS as
compared to patients treated with cystectomy alone (p = 0.002).
Variant histologies and non-UC have also been linked to worse outcomes after NAC, but there is, as
yet, insufficient data to conclude that they can be considered as predictive markers [230].
6.3.2
Molecular markers
Several predictive biomarkers have been investigated such as serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
[231], circulating tumour cells as well as defects in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes including ERCC2, ATM,
RB1 and FANCC that may predict response to cisplatin-based NAC [232, 233]. More recently, alterations in
FGFR3 including both mutations and gene fusions have been shown to be associated with response to FGFR
inhibitors [234, 235].
More recent efforts have focused on markers for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibition.
Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry has been evaluated in several
studies with mixed results which may in part be related to the use of different antibodies and various scoring
systems evaluating different compartments, i.e., tumour cells, immune cells, or both. The major limitation
of PD-L1 staining relates to the significant proportion of PD-L1-negative patients that respond to immune
checkpoint blockade. For example, in the IMvigor 210 phase II study of atezolizumab in patients with
advanced/metastatic UC who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy, responses were seen in 18% of
patients with low/no PD-L1 expression [236]. At present, the only indication for PD-L1 testing relates to the use
of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with locally-advanced or metastatic UC unfit for
cisplatin-containing chemotherapy who have not received prior therapy. In this setting, atezolizumab (approved
by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency [EMA]) or pembrolizumab (EMA approval only) should only be
used in patients unfit for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy whose tumours overexpress PD-L1 (i.e., in case of
atezolizumab; tumour-infiltrating immune cells [IC] covering > 5% of the tumour area using the SP142 assay;
in case of pembrolizumab, a combined positive score (CPS) of > 10 using the Dako 22C33 platform) [237].
The FDA revised the label for pembrolizumab in patients with advanced UC with approval in first line only for
patients not eligible for any platinum-based chemotherapy, however, irrespective of PD-L1 status.
Urothelial cancer is associated with a high tumour mutational burden (TMB) [238]. Both predicted neoantigen
burden and TMB have been associated with response to immune checkpoint blockade in several malignancies.
High TMB has been associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic BC [236, 239].
Conflicting results have been seen in studies evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors in the neoadjuvant
setting with the Pembrolizumab as Neoadjuvant Therapy Before Radical Cystectomy in Patients With MuscleInvasive Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma (PURE)-01 study demonstrating an association of high TMB with

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

23

response while there was no association with atezolizumab in the Phase II study investigating the safety and
efficacy of neoadjuvant atezolizumab in MIBC (ABACUS) [240, 241].
Other markers that have been evaluated in predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors include
molecular subtypes as discussed earlier, CD8 expression by immunohistochemistry and other immune gene
cell signatures. Recent work has focused on the importance of stroma including the role of transforming
growth factors (TGFs) in predicting response to immune checkpoint blockade [242, 243]. Most recently,
Powles et al., have reported on the potential for ctDNA to guide the use of adjuvant IO in UC [244]. In 581
patients from a phase III RCT of adjuvant atezolizumab vs. observation in UC, ctDNA testing at the start of
therapy identified 214 (37%) patients who were positive for ctDNA and who had poor prognosis (observation
arm HR = 6.3, 95% CI: 4.45–8.92; p < 0.0001). Patients who were positive for ctDNA had improved DFS and
OS in the atezolizumab arm vs. the observation arm (DFS: HR = 0.58 [95% CI: 0.43–0.79]; p = 0.0024, OS:
HR = 0.59 [95% CI: 0.41–0.86]). There was no difference in DFS or OS between treatment arms for patients
who were negative for ctDNA. The rate of ctDNA clearance at week 6 was higher in the atezolizumab arm
(18%) than in the observation arm (4%) (p = 0.0204). An ongoing clinical trial (IMvigor011) is evaluating
atezolizumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with high-risk MIBC who are ctDNA positive following cystectomy
[245]. Although promising, there are currently no validated predictive molecular markers that are routinely used
in clinical practice. Further validation studies are awaited.

6.4

Conclusion

The updated TCGA and other efforts have refined our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of BC
biology. Molecular subtypes, immune gene signatures as well as stromal signatures may ultimately have an
important role in predicting response to IO. Although PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry and TMB
have demonstrated predictive value in certain settings, additional studies are needed. Prospectively validated
prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers will present valuable adjuncts to clinical and pathological data,
but large phase III RCTs with long-term follow-up will be needed to clarify the many questions remaining.

7.1.1
Introduction
The standard treatment for patients with urothelial MIBC and MIBC with variant histologies is RC. However, RC
only provides 5-year survival in about 50% of patients [246-250]. To improve survival in patients with cN0M0
disease, cisplatin-based NAC has been used since the 1980s [246-252].
7.1.2
Role of cisplatin-based chemotherapy
There are theoretical advantages and disadvantages of administering chemotherapy before planned definitive
surgery to patients with resectable muscle-invasive cN0M0 UC of the bladder:
•
Chemotherapy is delivered at the earliest time-point, when the burden of micrometastatic disease is
expected to be low.
•
Potential reflection of in-vivo chemosensitivity.
•
Tolerability of chemotherapy and patient compliance are expected to be better pre-cystectomy.
•
Patients may respond to NAC and have a favourable pathological response as determined mainly by
achieving ypT0, < ypT1, ypN0 and negative surgical margins. A recently reported analysis to identify the
optimal definition of pathological response reported a significantly higher risk of recurrence in patients
with ypTaN0 or ypT1N0 disease (with or without Tis) at RC and thus proposed that optimal pathological
response after NAC be defined as attainment of ypT0N0/ypTisN0 at RC [253].
•
Delayed cystectomy might compromise the outcome in patients not sensitive to chemotherapy [254-256].
A comparative survival analysis of patients treated with NAC and RC vs. RC alone based on data from the
U.S. National Cancer Database showed that organ-confined disease (< pT2) after NAC was associated

with decreased risk of death (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79–0.91) compared to RC alone, whereas > pT2
was associated with increased risk of death (HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.34–1.60) [257]. However, there are
no prospective trials indicating that delayed surgery due to NAC has a negative impact on survival. In
the phase III VESPER trial, comparing gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) vs. high-dose-intensity methotrexate,
vinblastine, doxorubicine and cisplatin (HD-MVAC) in the peri-operative setting, approximately 90% of
patients proceeded to surgery (with median delay of 48 days for GC and 51 days for dd-MVAC) [258].
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not seem to affect the outcome of surgical morbidity. In one
randomised trial the same distribution of grade 3–4 post-operative complications was seen in both
treatment arms [259]. In the combined Nordic trials (n = 620), NAC did not have a major adverse effect
on the percentage of performable cystectomies. The cystectomy frequency was 86% in the experimental
arm and 87% in the control arm with 71% of patients receiving all three chemotherapy cycles [260].
Clinical staging using bimanual palpation, CT or MRI may result in over- and understaging and have a
staging accuracy of only 70% [88]. Overtreatment is a possible negative consequence.
Gender may have an impact on chemotherapeutic response and oncologic outcomes [261, 262]. Female
patients tend to have a better cancer-related response to NAC as compared to male patients.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should only be used in patients eligible for cisplatin-combination
chemotherapy; other combinations (or monotherapies) are inferior in metastatic BC and have not been
fully tested in a neoadjuvant setting [259, 263-271].

7.1.2.1
Summary of available data
Several phase III RCTs addressed the potential survival benefit of NAC administration [259, 263-268, 272-276].
The main differences in trial designs were the type of chemotherapy (i.e., single-agent cisplatin or combination
chemotherapy) and the number of cycles provided. Patients had to be fit for cisplatin. Since these studies
differed considerably for patient numbers, patient characteristics (e.g., clinical T-stages included) and the type
of definitive treatment offered (cystectomy and/or RT), pooling of results was not possible.
Three meta-analyses were undertaken to establish if NAC prolongs survival [269-271]. In a meta-analysis
including updated patient data from 11 randomised trials (n = 3,005), a significant survival benefit was shown
in favour of NAC [271]. The most recent meta-analysis included four additional RCTs, and used the updated
results from the Nordic I, Nordic II, and BA06 30894 trials including data from 427 new patients and updated
information from 1,596 patients. The results of this analysis confirmed the previously published data and
showed an 8% absolute improvement in survival at five years with a number needed-to-treat of 12.5 [277].
Only cisplatin-combination chemotherapy with at least one additional chemotherapeutic agent resulted in a
meaningful therapeutic benefit [269, 271]; the regimens tested were methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin
(epirubicin) plus cisplatin (MVA(E)C), cisplatin, methotrexate plus vinblastine (CMV), cisplatin plus methotrexate
(CM), cisplatin plus adriamycin and cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [278].
The updated analysis of a large phase III RCT [263] with a median follow-up of eight years confirmed previous
results and provided additional findings:
•
16% reduction in mortality risk;
•
improvement in 10-year survival from 30% to 36% with neoadjuvant CMV;
•
benefit with regard to distant metastases;
•
the addition of neoadjuvant CMV provided no benefit for locoregional control and locoregional DFS,
independent of the definitive treatment.
More modern chemotherapeutic regimens such as GC have shown similar pT0/pT1 rates as methotrexate,
vinblastine, adriamycin plus cisplatin in retrospective series and pooled data analyses [278-281]. Modified
dd-MVAC was tested in two small single-arm phase II studies demonstrating high rates of pathologic complete
remission [282, 283]. Moreover, a large cross-sectional analysis showed higher rates of down-staging and
pathological complete response for dd-MVAC [284].
In the GETUG/AFU V05 VESPER RCT of peri-operative chemotherapy, 500 patients were randomised to either
6 cycles of dd-MVAC once every 2 weeks vs. 4 cycles of GC once every 3 weeks prior to surgery (neoadjuvant
group) or after surgery (adjuvant group) with a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years. In
493 patients (437 neoadjuvant and 56 adjuvant), a similar pathologic response rate (ypT0N0) in patients treated
with dd-MVAC 42% and GC 36% (p = 0.2) was seen. The < ypT2N0 rate was 63% and 50% in the dd-MVAC
and GC patients, respectively. Organ-confined response (< ypT3N0) was observed more frequently in the
dd-MVAC arm (77% vs. 63%, p = 0.001). For all patients in the trial, 3-year PFS was improved in the dd-MVAC
arm, but the study did not meet its primary endpoint (3-year rate: 64% vs. 56%, HR: 0.77 [95% CI: 0.57–1.02],
p = 0.066); nevertheless, the dd-MVAC arm was associated with a significantly longer time to progression

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

25

(3-year rate: 69% vs. 58%, HR: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.50–0.93], p = 0.014). In the neoadjuvant group, PFS at 3 years
was significantly higher in the dd-MVAC arm (66% vs. 56%, HR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.51–0.96], p = 0.025). Dosedense MVAC was associated with more severe asthenia and GI side effects than GC [258, 285]. Another dosedense regimen using GC was reported in two small phase II trials [286, 287]. While pathological response rates
(< pT2) in the range of 45%–57% were achieved, one trial had to be closed prematurely due to high rates of
severe vascular events [286]. This approach is therefore not recommended outside of clinical trials.
As an alternative to the standard dose of cisplatin-based NAC with 70 mg/m2 on day 1, split-dose
modifications regimens are often used with 35 mg/m2 on days 1+8 or days 1+2. In a retrospective analysis
the standard schedule was compared to a split-dose schedule in terms of complete and partial pathological
response. A lower number of complete and partial response rates was seen in the split-dose group, but these
results were not statistically significant [288].
Efforts aimed at improving the efficacy of NAC in MIBC are ongoing. In the recently reported doubleblind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase II NEOBLADE trial of neoadjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin
chemotherapy with nintedanib, a small molecule inhibitor that targets tyrosine kinases PDGFR, FGFR-1, and
VEGFR-2, or placebo, in locally-advanced MIBC, the addition of nintedanib to chemotherapy was safe but did
not improve the rate of pathological complete response [289].
There seem to be differences in the outcomes of patients treated with NAC for primary or secondary MIBC with
retrospective data suggesting that patients with primary MIBC have better pathologic response rates to NAC in
comparison to patients with secondary MIBC [290]. However, in the absence of prospective data, patients with
secondary MIBC should be treated similarly to those presenting with primary MIBC [229].
It is unclear, if patients with non-UC histology will also benefit from NAC. A retrospective analysis demonstrated
that patients with neuroendocrine tumours had improved OS and lower rates of non-organ-confined disease
when receiving neoadjuvant cisplatinum/etoposide chemotherapy. In case of micropapillary differentiation,
sarcomatoid differentiation and adenocarcinoma, lower rates of non-organ confined disease were found, but
no statistically significant impact on OS. Patients with SCC did not benefit from NAC [291]. A 2019 systematic
review showed benefit of NAC for patients with micropapillary-, plasmacytoid-, sarcomatoid-, and mixed
variants but especially for patients with neuroendocrine tumours [69]. A U.S. National Cancer Database study
evaluating potential associations between receipt of NAC, pathological downstaging and OS for patients
with histological subtype MIBC demonstrated that NAC was associated with pathological downstaging for
all MIBC histological subtypes (UC; sarcomatoid UC; micropapillary UC; SCC; neuroendocrine carcinoma;
and adenocarcinoma), with improved OS for patients with UC, sarcomatoid variant UC and neuroendocrine
carcinoma [292].
7.1.3
The role of imaging and predictive biomarkers (see also section 5.2)
Data from small imaging studies aiming to identify responders in patients treated with NAC suggest that
response after two cycles of treatment is predictive of outcome. Although mpMRI has the advantage of better
resolution of the bladder wall tissue planes as compared to CT, it is not ready yet for standard patient care.
However, bladder mpMRI may be useful to inform on tumour stage after TURB and response to NAC [118]. So
far PET/CT, MRI or DCE-MRI cannot accurately assess treatment response [293-296]. To identify progression
during NAC, imaging is being used in many centres notwithstanding the lack of supporting evidence.
For responders to NAC, especially in those with a complete response (pT0 N0), treatment has a
major positive impact on OS [297, 298]. Therefore, reliable predictive markers to identify patients most likely to
benefit from chemotherapy are needed. A recently reported study investigated how molecular subtypes impact
pathological response and survival in patients receiving pre-operative cisplatin-based chemotherapy [299].
Patients with genomically unstable (GU) and urothelial-like (Uro) tumours had higher proportions of complete
pathological response (16/31 [52%] and 17/54 [31%]), vs. five out of 24 (21%) for the basal/squamous (Ba/
Sq) subtype following NAC and RC. Molecular subtype was independently associated with improved survival
for patients with GU tumours (HR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.11–0.79) and UroC tumours (HR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.14–0.94)
compared with Ba/Sq tumours, adjusting for clinical stage. Molecular tumour profiling might guide the use of
NAC in the future but, as yet, this is not applicable in routine practice [300-302] (see Chapter 6 - Markers).
7.1.4
Role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy
Inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint has demonstrated significant benefit in patients with unresectable and
metastatic BC in the second-line setting and in platinum-ineligible PD-L1+ patients as first-line treatment
using different agents. Checkpoint inhibitors are increasingly tested also in the neoadjuvant setting; either as
monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy or CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibition. Data from two phase II

26

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

trials have been presented with encouraging results [240, 241]. The results of the phase II trial using the PD-1
inhibitor pembrolizumab reported a complete pathological remission (pT0) in 42% and pathological response
(< pT2) in 54% of patients, whereas in the single-arm phase II trial with atezolizumab a pathologic complete
response rate of 31% was reported. In the recently published update to the ABACUS trial using single-agent
atezolizumab, two-year DFS and OS were 68% (95% CI: 58–76) and 77% (95% CI: 68–85), respectively with
two-year DFS in patients achieving a pathological complete response of 85% (95% CI: 65–94) [303].
Two recently published studies have investigated the use of neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy in patients
with MIBC. In a phase II study of gemcitabine plus split-dose cisplatin and pembrolizumab in patients with
MIBC, 22 of 39 patients (56% [95% CI: 40–72]) achieved < pT2N0 and 14 of 39 (36% [95% CI: 21–53])
achieved pT0N0 [304]. In a second phase II study evaluating neoadjuvant atezolizumab with gemcitabine and
cisplatin; 27 of 39 patients (69%) were < pT2N0 and 16 (41%) pT0N0. No patient with < pT2N0 relapsed and
four (11%) with > pT2N0 relapsed with a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range: 7.0–33.7 months) [305]. With
the promising pathologic response rates, several larger studies are currently investigating the potential role for
neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy in patients with MIBC.
At present, the results with immunotherapy alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, are promising but not
yet approved in routine practice.
7.1.5

Summary of evidence and guidelines for neoadjuvant therapy

Summary of evidence
Neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy improves OS (5–8% at five years).
Neoadjuvant treatment may have a major impact on OS in patients who achieve ypT0 or < ypT2.
Currently immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy, or in different combinations with
or without chemotherapy, is being tested in phase II and III trials. Initial results are promising.
There are still no reliable tools available to select patients who have a higher probability of benefitting
from NAC. In the future, genetic markers in a personalised medicine setting might facilitate the
selection of patients for NAC and differentiate responders from non-responders.
Recommendations
If eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy, offer neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination
chemotherapy to patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (T2-T4a, cN0 M0).
Do not offer NAC to patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.
Only offer neoadjuvant immunotherapy to patients within a clinical trial setting.

Pre- and post-operative radiotherapy in muscle-invasive bladder cancer

7.2.1
Post-operative radiotherapy
Given the high rates of local-regional failure after RC in patients with locally-advanced (pT3–4) BC, estimated
at ~30%, as well as the high risk of distant failure and poor survival for these patients, there is an interest
in adjuvant therapies that address both the risk of local and distant disease. Data on adjuvant RT after RC
are limited and further prospective studies are needed, but a more recent phase II trial compared adjuvant
sequential chemotherapy and radiation vs. adjuvant chemotherapy alone in 120 patients with locally-advanced
disease and negative margins after RC (with one or more risk factors: > pT3b, grade 3, or node-positive), in a
study population with 53% UC and 47% SCC. Addition of adjuvant RT to chemotherapy alone was associated
with a statistically significant improvement in local relapse-free survival (at 2 years 96% vs. 69% favouring the
addition of RT). Disease-free survival and OS also favoured the addition of RT, but those differences were not
statistically significant and the study was not powered for those endpoints. Late-grade > 3 GI toxicity in the
chemoradiation arm was low (7% of patients) [306].
A 2019 systematic review evaluating the efficacy of adjuvant radiation for BC or UTUC found no clear benefit of
adjuvant radiation following radical surgery (e.g., cystectomy), although the combination of adjuvant radiation
with chemotherapy may be beneficial in locally-advanced disease [307].
Adjuvant radiation might be considered in patients with pT3/pT4 pN0–2 urothelial BC following RC, although
this approach has been evaluated in only a limited number of studies without conclusive data demonstrating
improvements in OS. Radiation fields should encompass areas at risk for harbouring residual microscopic
disease based on pathologic findings at surgery and may include the cystectomy bed and pelvic LNs. Doses in

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

27

the range of 45 to 50.4 Gy may be considered. A small retrospective study of 25 patients (median age 64 years)
evaluated acute and late toxicity of moderate doses of pelvic RT (range, 45–50.4 Gy). After a median follow-up
of 10.4 months the authors concluded that orthotopic ileal neobladders can tolerate moderate radiation doses
without significant induced morbidity. Most of the acute GI toxicity seen was grade 1, four patients developed
acute grade 2 toxicity; three of whom had been treated by NAC [308].
For patients not treated with NAC, it may be reasonable to sandwich adjuvant radiation between
cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of concurrent radiosensitising chemotherapy in the
adjuvant setting needs further study.
7.2.2
Pre-operative radiotherapy
To date, six RCTs have been published investigating pre-operative RT, although all are from several decades
ago. In the largest trial, pre-operative RT at a dose of 45 Gy was used, resulting in a significant increase in
pathological complete response (9% to 34%) in favour of pre-operative RT, which was also a prognostic factor
for survival [309]. The OS data were difficult to interpret since chemotherapy was used in a subset of patients
only and more than 50% of patients (241/475) did not receive the planned treatment and were excluded
from the final analyses. Two smaller studies using a dose of 20 Gy showed only a small survival advantage
in > T3 tumours [310, 311]. Two other small trials confirmed downstaging after pre-operative RT [312, 313].
In a retrospective analysis of 1,846 evaluable patients, only 34 patients received RT prior to orthotopic
neobladder reconstruction. The authors conclude that following pelvic RT, a neobladder is possible in highly
selected patients with statistically similar peri-operative complication rates compared to patients who did not
receive prior RT. Patient selection, with oncologic factors (positive urethral margins, nodal involvement, and
extravascular disease) more commonly than technical factors (adhesions/difficult dissection, bleeding, urethral
stricture) influencing conversion from a planned neobladder reconstruction [314].
A meta-analysis of five RCTs showed a difference in 5-year survival (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.48–1.06) in favour
of pre-operative RT [315]. However, the meta-analysis was potentially biased by data from the largest trial in
which patients were not given the planned treatment. When the largest trial was excluded from the analysis, the
OR became 0.94 (95% CI: 0.57–1.55), which was not significant.
A more recent RCT, comparing pre-operative vs. post-operative RT and RC (n = 100), showed
comparable OS, DFS and complication rates [316]. Approximately half of these patients had UC, while the
other half had SCC. In general, such older data is limited in being able to provide a robust evidence base for
modern guideline recommendations.
7.2.3

Summary of evidence and guidelines for pre- and post-operative radiotherapy

Summary of evidence
No contemporary data exists to support that pre-operative RT for operable MIBC increases survival.
Pre-operative RT for operable MIBC, using a dose of 45–50 Gy in fractions of 1.8–2 Gy, results in
down-staging after 4 to 6 weeks.
Limited evidence supports the safe use of pre- and post-operative RT in case a neobladder is planned
or in situ.
Limited high-quality evidence supports the use of pre-operative RT to decrease local recurrence of
MIBC after RC.
Addition of adjuvant RT to chemotherapy is associated with an improvement in local relapse-free
survival following cystectomy for locally-advanced bladder cancer (pT3b–4, or node-positive).
Recommendations
Do not offer pre-operative radiotherapy (RT) for operable muscle-invasive bladder cancer
since it will only result in down-staging, but will not improve survival.
Do not offer pre-operative RT when subsequent radical cystectomy (RC) with urinary
diversion is planned.
Consider offering adjuvant RT in addition to chemotherapy following RC, based on
pathologic risk (pT3b–4 or positive nodes or positive margins).

Radical surgery and urinary diversion

7.3.1
Removal of the tumour-bearing bladder
7.3.1.1
Introduction
Standard treatment for patients with MIBC consists of RC, pelvic LN dissection, and urinary diversion, withor without NAC [317]. An increasing focus on QoL contributes to a growing trend of utilizing bladder-sparing
approaches, such as RT or chemoradiation in selected patients (see Section 7.5). Performance status and
life expectancy influence the choice of primary management as well as the type of urinary diversion with RC
being reserved for patients with a longer life expectancy without concomitant disease and a better PS. Frailty,
nutritional status and decreased kidney function are conditions significantly related to an increased risk of postoperative adverse events (AEs) [318-320].
7.3.1.2
Radical cystectomy: timing
A meta-analysis including 19 studies concluded that a delay of > 3 months has a negative effect on OS (HR:
134, 95% CI: 1.18–1.53). Authors highlighted the lack of standardisation regarding the definition of delays
which made it impossible to identify a clear cut-off time [321]. Overall conclusion was that BC patients
scheduled for RC should be treated without delays to maximise survival.
7.3.2
Radical cystectomy: indications
Radical cystectomy is recommended in patients with T2–T4a, N0M0 disease, very high-risk NMIBC, BCGrefractory, BCG-relapsing and BCG-unresponsive NMIBC (see EAU Guidelines on Non-muscle-invasive
Bladder Cancer [2]), as well as extensive papillary disease that cannot be controlled with TURBT and
intravesical chemotherapy/immunotherapy alone.
Salvage cystectomy is indicated in non-responders to conservative therapy, i.e., recurrence after
bladder-sparing treatment. It is also used as a purely palliative intervention, including for fistula formation, pain
and recurrent uncontrollable haematuria (see Section 7.4.1 - Palliative cystectomy).
7.3.3
Radical cystectomy: technique and extent
Different approaches have been described to improve voiding and sexual function in patients undergoing RC
for BC. No consensus exists regarding which approach preserves function best. Concern remains regarding
the impact of ‘sparing-techniques’ on oncological outcomes.
7.3.3.1
Radical cystectomy in men
In men, standard RC includes removal of the bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, distal ureters, and regional LNs.
7.3.3.1.1 Concomitant prostate cancer
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13,140 patients showed an incidental prostate cancer rate of 24%
[322]. Incidental prostate cancer was associated with higher age and lower 5-year OS. However, the lower OS
can be explained by the higher age of patients with incidental prostate cancer. Pathological reporting of the
specimens should follow the recommendations as presented in the EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG
Guidelines on Prostate Cancer [323].
7.3.3.1.2 Sexual-preserving techniques
Four main types have been described:
1.
Prostate sparing cystectomy: part of or the whole prostate is preserved including seminal vesicles, vas
deferens and neurovascular bundles.
2.
Capsule sparing cystectomy: the capsule or peripheral part of the prostate is preserved with adenoma
(including prostatic urethra) removed by TURP or en bloc with the bladder. Seminal vesicles, vas deferens
and neurovascular bundles are also preserved.
3.
Seminal sparing cystectomy: seminal vesicles, vas deferens and neurovascular bundles are preserved.
4.
Nerve-sparing cystectomy: the neurovascular bundles are the only tissue left in place.
The systematic review on oncological and functional outcomes of sexual function-preserving cystectomy in
men indentified 12 studies (n = 1,098) [324]. In the majority of cases, an open surgical approach was used and
the urinary diversion of choice was an orthotopic neobladder. Median follow-up was longer than three years in
nine studies, with three studies presenting results with a median follow-up longer than five years.
The majority of the studies included patients who were potent pre-operatively with organ-confined disease
without tumour in the bladder neck and/or prostatic urethra. Prostate cancer was ruled out in all of the sexualpreserving cystectomy (SPC) techniques, except in the nerve-sparing approach [323].
Oncological outcomes did not differ between groups in any of the comparative studies that

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

29

measured local recurrence, metastatic recurrence, DSS and OS, at a median follow-up of three to five years.
For techniques preserving prostatic tissue (prostate- or capsule-sparing), rates of incidental prostate
cancer in the intervention group ranged from 0–15%. Incidental prostate cancer with ISUP grade > 4 was not
reported.
Post-operative potency was significantly better in patients who underwent any type of SPC
technique compared to conventional RC (p < 0.05), ranging from 80–90%, 50–100% and 29–78% for prostate-,
capsule- or nerve-sparing techniques, respectively. Urinary continence, defined as the use of ‘no pads’ in the
majority of studies, ranged from 88–100% (day-time continence) and from 31–96% (night-time continence)
in the prostate-sparing cystectomy patients. No major differences were seen with regard to continence rates
between any of these approaches.
The evidence base suggest that these procedures may yield better sexual outcomes than standard RC without
compromising oncological outcomes. However, the overall quality of the evidence was moderate, and hence if
a SPC technique is offered, patients must be carefully selected, counselled and closely monitored.

7.3.3.2
Radical cystectomy in women
Historically, standard RC in women includes removal of the bladder, the entire urethra and adjacent vagina,
uterus, distal ureters, and regional LNs. Pelvic floor disorders, sexual and voiding dysfunction in female
patients are prevalent after RC [325]. As part of the pre-operative evaluation a gynaecological history should
be obtained and patients should be counselled on the potential negative impact of RC on sexual function and/
or vaginal prolapse. Most importantly, a history of cervical cancer screening, abnormal vaginal bleeding and a
family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer should be recorded, as well as ruling out possible pelvic organ
prolapse. Post-operatively, screening for sexual and urinary function and prolapse, is mandatory.
Pelvic organ-preserving techniques involve preserving the neurovascular bundle, vagina, uterus,
ovaries or variations of any of the stated techniques. From an oncological point of view, concomitant
malignancy in gynaecological organs is rare and local recurrences reported after RC are infrequent [326,
327]. In premenopausal women, by preserving ovaries, hormonal homeostasis will be preserved, decreasing
risk of cognitive impairment, cardiovascular diseases and loss of bone density. In case of an increased risk
of hereditary breast or ovarian cancer (i.e., BRCA1/2 mutation carriers or patients with Lynch syndrome),
salpingooophorectomy should be advised after childbearing and to all women over 40 years of age [328]. On
the other hand, preservation of the uterus and vagina will provide the necessary support for the neobladder,
thereby reducing the risk of urinary retention. It also helps to avoid post-operative prolapse as removal of
the uterus predisposes to an anterior or posterior vaginal prolapse. In case of an already existing prolapse
of the uterus, either isolated or combined with a vaginal prolapse, removing the uterus will be beneficial. It is
noteworthy that by resecting the vaginal wall, the vagina shortens which could impair sexual satisfaction and
function.
Based on retrospective low quality data only, a systematic review evaluating the advantages and
disadvantages of sexual-function preserving RC and orthotopic neobladder in female patients concluded that
in well-selected patients, sparing female reproductive organs during RC appears to be oncologically safe and
provides improved functional outcomes [329]. Historically, patients selection has been limited to cT2 disease,
but there are recent encouraging reports that support including women with more advanced T-stage and
histological subtypes without compromising oncological outcomes [330].

7.3.4
Lymphadenectomy: role and extent
The optimal extent of lymphadectomy (LND) has not been established to date. Standard LND in MIBC patients
involves removal of nodal tissue cranially up to the common iliac bifurcation, with the ureter being the medial
border, and including the internal iliac, presacral, obturator fossa and external iliac nodes. The lateral borders
are the genitofemoral nerves, caudally the circumflex iliac vein, the lacunar ligament and the LN of Cloquet
[332]. Limited LND includes the nodes from the true pelvis, but excluding the deep obturator nodes. Extended
LND includes the same boundaries as a standard LND, except for the cranial limit which is the region of the aortic
bifurcation [333]. A super-extended LND extends cranially to the level of the inferior mesenteric artery [334].
Controversies in the clinical importance of LND are related to the question whether it should be considered a
staging tool, a therapeutic procedure, or both.
7.3.4.1
Diagnostic value of lymphadenectomy
To understand the lymphatic spread in MIBC, two important autopsy studies have been performed. The first
study analysed 367 patients with a history of cystectomy or MIBC at the time of autopsy. In total, 215 patients
(59%) had node-positive disease [335]. In these patients 92% of the positive LNs were regional (perivesical or
pelvic), 72% retroperitoneal and 35% abdominal.
The second autopsy study focused on the nodal yield when super-extended pelvic LND was
performed. Substantial inter-individual differences were found with counts ranging from 10 to 53 nodes [336].
These findings demonstrate the limited utility of node count as a surrogate for extent of dissection, supporting
a template-based LND instead.
In addition to autopsy studies, several authors adressed the spread of lymphatic disease by performing LN
mapping studies in MIBC patients undergoing RC and (super)extended PLND [337-339]. These studies have
demonstrated that LN-positive disease is present in approximately 25% of patients. In the group of nodepositive patients, positive LNs cranial to the iliac bifurcation were present in over 40% of patients, however, skip
LN metastasis were very rare (1%), as seen in autopsy studies. From a staging perspective only, these studies
suggest that a standard LND should be sufficient to identify nearly all patients with node-positive disease.
7.3.4.2
Therapeutic value of lymphadenectomy
The therapeutic value of LND is a topic of continuous debate. To assess the oncological outcomes of different
LND templates, a systematic review including 19 studies was performed [340].
Five studies compared LND vs. no LND and reported better oncological outcomes for the LND
group. Seven out of twelve studies comparing (super)extended with limited or standard LND reported a
beneficial outcome for (super)extended LND in at least a subset of patients. Two studies did not show a
difference in outcome between extended and super-extended LND [340].
To date, the only prospective randomised data is available from the LEA trial performed in Germany.
In this trial, patients with MIBC (n = 346) or T1G3 disease (n = 55) were included. Patients underwent either a
limited LND (n= 203) or extended LND (n = 198). Survival differences between the groups were seen, in favour of
extended LND. However, extended LND failed to show a significant advantage (the trial was designed to show
an absolute improvement of 15% in 5-year RFS by extended LND) over limited LND for RFS, CSS, and OS.
In conclusion, there no high level data to support an extended LND, but data with lower level of evidence
suggest that extended LND might be beneficial compared to more limited LND templates.

7.3.5
Robotic-assisted laparoscopic cystectomy
A number of recent systematic reviews comparing open RC (ORC) and robot-assisted RC (RARC) reach similar
conclusions; RARC has an approximately one-day shorter length of hospital stay (LOS) and less blood loss, but
a longer operative time. Complication rates seem similar for both approaches but all published reviews suffer
from low quality data.
In minimally-invasive cystectomy, with increasing age, LOS is markedly shorter; up to 2.56 days in
patients over 80 years old [341].
Although the low level of evidence of the studies included in these reviews remains a major limitation, a recent
Cochrane review incorporating data from all five published RCTs corroborates most findings [342]. Time to
recurrence, positive surgical margin rates, grade 3–5 complications and QoL were comparable for RARC and
ORC, whilst transfusion rate was likely lower after RARC. For other endpoints outcomes were uncertain due to
study limitations.
An economic evaluation (healthcare and societal perspective) of a Dutch prospective multi-centre comparative
effectiveness study asessing ORC (n = 168) vs. RARC (n = 180) showed that both mean healthcare costs and
societal costs per patient were significantly higher after RARC, resulting in an increase in QALYs of 0.02 [343].
Data on post-RC uretero-enteric stricture rates for both ORC and RARC remain inconclusive. Results are
mainly reported by high-volume centres or derive from population-based studies with a large variety of
endpoints and poor controlling of potential confounders, making comparison difficult [344-348]. Especially
those managed by extracorporeal diversion (RARC-ECUD) tend to have more strictures compared to
intracorporeal diversion (RARC-ICUD) [348]. This is explained by the need for more extensive dissection of
ureter in RARC-ECUD, more tension, resulting in impaired blood supply [349, 350].
Recurrence-free survival, CSS and OS have been documented as similar in all RCTs. A larger (n = 595)
single-centre study with a median follow-up of over five years also found comparable recurrence and survival
data, including atypical recurrences (defined as one or a combination of the following: portsite metastasis
or peritoneal carcinomatosis) [351]. Interrestingly, Wei et al., detected residual cancer cells in pelvic washing
specimens during or after, but not before, RARC in approximately half of the patients (9/17), which was
associated with aggressive histological subtypes and cancer recurrence. These findings need confirmation in
larger studies [352].
Most reviewed series offer extracorporeal reconstruction. Hussein et al., retrospectively compared
extracorporeal reconstruction (n = 1,031) to intracorporeal reconstruction (n = 1,094); the latter was associated
with a shorter operative time and fewer blood transfusions but more high-grade complications, which
decreased over time [353]. A retrospective report from a high-volume centre found less (major) complications
after intracorporeal reconstruction (n = 301) as compared to extracorporeal reconstruction (n = 375) and open
RC (n = 272) [354].
A RCT comparing recovery and morbidity after ORC (n = 169) and RARC (n = 169) with intracorporeal diversion
reported on the number of days alive and out of the hospital within 90 days of surgery which was 82 and 80
days, respectively [355]. In total, 89% of the patients underwent ileal conduit diversion. Thromboembolic
complications and wound complications were less common with robotic surgery. Quality of life was initially
worse after open surgery, but the difference was not significant after 12 weeks. There were no statistically
significant differences in cancer recurrence or overall mortality at median follow-up of 18.4 months.
7.3.5.1

Summary of evidence and guidelines for robotic-assisted laparoscopic cystectomy

Summary of evidence
Robot-assisted radical cystectomy has longer operative time (1–1.5 hours) and higher costs, but
shorter length of hospital stay (1–1.5 days) and less blood loss compared to ORC.
Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in similar rates of (major) complications.
Most endpoints, if reported, including intermediate-term oncological endpoint and QoL, are similar for
RARC and ORC.
Surgeons experience and institutional volume are considered the key factor for outcome of both
RARC and ORC, not the technique.

7.3.6
Urinary diversion after radical cystectomy
Different types of segments of the intestinal tract can be used to reconstruct the urinary tract, including the
ileum, colon and appendix, with ileum used in most cases. Several studies have compared advantages and
disadvantages in terms of QoL, sexual function, urinary continence and body image between different urinary
diversions [356], but further research evaluating the impact of tumour stage, functional- and socio-economic
status are needed.
7.3.6.1
Different types of urinary diversion
For the choice of urinary diversion, comorbidity, cardiac, pulmonary and cognitive function are important
factors that should be considered, along with the patient’s social support and preference (see Section patient
selection/comorbidities). Age > 80 years is often considered to be the threshold after which neobladder
reconstruction is not recommended. However, there is no exact age for a strict contraindication [357].
Randomised controlled trials comparing conduit diversion with neobladder or continent cutaneous diversion
have not been performed.
7.3.6.1.1 Uretero-cutaneostomy
Ureteral diversion to the abdominal wall is the simplest form of cutaneous diversion. Operating time,
complication rate, blood loss, transfusion rate, stay at intensive care and length of hospital stay are lower in
patients treated with ureterocutaneostomy as compared to ileal conduit [358]. In frail patients and/or in those
with a solitary kidney who need a supravesical diversion, uretero-cutaneostomy is the preferred procedure. In
case patients have both kidneys and need a uretero-cutaneostomy, either one ureter, to which the other shorter
one is attached end-to-side, is connected to the skin (trans-uretero-cutaneostomy) or both ureters may be
directly anastomosed to the abdominal wall creating a stoma.
Due to the smaller diameter of the ureters, stoma stenosis and ascending UTIs have been observed
more frequently for this technique as compared to using small or large bowel to create an intestinal stoma [359].
7.3.6.1.2 Ileal conduit
The ileal conduit is an established option with well-known/predictable results. Early complications (30-day cut
off, used in most publications) include UTIs, pyelonephritis, ureteroileal leakage and stenosis which occur in
48% of patients [360].
7.3.6.1.3 Orthotopic neobladder
According to Dutch-, German- and Spanish bladder cancer registry data, an orthotopic bladder substitution
to the urethra is used in approximately 10–20% of both male and female patients. Emptying of the reservoir
anastomosed to the urethra requires abdominal straining, and sphincter relaxation. The terminal ileum is the GI
segment most often used for orthotopic bladder substitution. Early and late morbidity in up to 22% of patients
is reported [361].
Various forms of UUT reflux protection, including a simple isoperistaltic tunnel, ileal intussusception, tapered
ileal prolongation implanted subserosally, and direct (sub)mucosal or subserosal ureteral implantation, have
been described [362, 363]. According to the long-term results, the UUT is protected sufficiently by either
method [361].
A study comparing cancer control and patterns of disease recurrence in patients with neobladder
and ileal conduit showed no difference in CSS between the two groups when adjusting for pathological stage
[364]. Urethral recurrence in neobladder patients seems rare (0.8–13.7% [pooled estimate of 4.6% in both male
and female patients, also considering the significantly higher recurrence rates in male patients]) [365]. These
results indicate that neobladder in male and female patients does not compromise the oncological outcome of
cystectomy.
7.3.6.1.4 Continent cutaneous urinary diversion
Continent cutaneous urinary diversion (a low-pressure detubularised ileal reservoir for self-catheterisation)
and uretero-rectosigmoidostomy are rarely used techniques nowadays, due to their high complication rates,
including stomal stenosis, incontinence in the continent cutaneous diversion, UUT infections and stone
formation in case of uretero-rectosigmoidostomy [366].

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

33

7.3.6.2
Patient selection
Ensuring that patients make a well-informed decision about the type of urinary diversion is associated with less
decision regret post-operatively, independent of the method selected [367]. Therefore, all applicable forms of
urinary diversion should be discussed, taking into account patient preference, comorbidities, age and tumour
characteristics.
Diagnosis of an invasive urethral tumour prior to cystectomy leads to urethrectomy which is a
contraindication for a neobladder reconstruction. Non-muscle-invasive BC in prostatic urethra or bladder neck
biopsies does not necessarily preclude orthotopic neobladder substitution, provided that patients undergo
regular follow-up cystoscopy and urinary cytology [368]. In women undergoing RC the rate of concomitant
urethral malignancy has been reported to range from 12–16% [369]. Localisation of the primary tumour at the
bladder neck correlated strongly with concomitant urethral malignancy. Bladder neck biopsies prior to RC are
important in women scheduled for an orthotopic bladder substitute [370].
In the presence of positive LNs, orthotopic neobladder can be considered in case of N1 disease,
but not in N2 or N3 tumours [371].
Oncological results after orthotopic neobladder or illial conduit are similar in terms of local or distant
metastasis recurrence, but secondary urethral tumours seem less common in patients with a neobladder
compared to those with conduits or continent cutaneous diversions [372].
Patients undergoing continent urinary diversion must be motivated to learn about their diversion and to be
manually skilful to be able to deal with their diversion. Contraindications to continent urinary diversions include:
•
debilitating neurological and psychiatric illnesses;
•
limited life expectancy;
•
severe impaired liver or renal function.
Relative contraindications for an orthotopic neobladder are high-dose pre-operative RT, complex urethral
strictures and severe urethral sphincter-related incontinence [373].
A retrospective study including 1,383 patients showed that the risk of a decline in estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not significantly differ after ileal conduit vs. neobladder in patients with preoperative chronic kidney disease 2 (eGFR 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m2) or 3a (eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m2) [374].
Only age and anastomotic strictures were found to be associated with a decline in eGFR.
Currently, it is not possible to recommend a particular type of urinary diversion. However, most institutions
prefer ileal orthotopic neobladders and ileal conduits based on clinical experience. In selected patients, such
as patients with a single kidney, uretero-cutaneostomy is surgically the least burdensome type of diversion.
Recommendations related to RC and urinary diversions are listed in Section 7.3.10.
7.3.6.3
Peri-operative care
Patients treated according to a ‘Fast tract’/ERAS (Early Recovery After Surgery) protocol have shown to score
better on the emotional and physical functioning scores and suffer less from wound healing disorders, fever
and thrombosis [375].
Pre-operatively, the ERAS protocol recommends no bowel prepation or fasting. Other components are, for
example, same day admission, as well as carbohydrate loading and a pre-operative exercise programme.
Important post-operative components of the ERAS protocol are pain management, which involves reducing
the use of opioids; increasing the use of high-dose acetaminophen and/or ketorolacs (only as breakthrough
pain medication) and patients on ERAS experience more pain as compared to patients on a traditional protocol
(Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] 3.1 vs. 1.1, p < 0.001), but post-operative ileus decreased from 22% to 7.3%
(p = 0.003) [376].
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis may be implemented as part of an ERAS protocol. A singlecentre non-randomised study showed a significant lower 30-day VTE incidence rate in patients treated for 28
days with enoxaparin compared to patients without prophylaxis [377]. Data from the Ontario Cancer Registry
including 4,205 cystectomy patients of whom 1,084 received NAC showed that VTE rates are higher in patients
treated with NAC as compared to patients treated with cystectomy only (12% vs. 8%, p = 0.002) [378].
7.3.7
Morbidity and mortality
In four retrospective studies and one population-based cohort study, the peri-operative mortality after RC was
reported as 2.1–3.2% at 30 days and 3.4–8.0% at 90 days [379, 380]. Morbidity rates differ strongly according
to the reporting system used. Using the Clavien-Dindo Classification system complication rates ranged

34

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

from 50–88% (I–IV) and severe complications from 30–42% (> III) [381-384]. In large national databases and
institutional series, readmission rates are approximately 25% within 30 days of discharge [385]. Late morbidity
was usually linked to the type of urinary diversion (see also above). Early morbidity associated with RC for
NMIBC (at high risk for disease progression) is similar and no less than that associated with muscle-invasive
tumours [386, 387]. In general, lower morbidity and (peri-operative) mortality have been observed by surgeons
and in hospitals with a higher case load and therefore more experience [388-391].

 systematic review showed that peri-operative blood transfusion (PBT) in patients who undergo RC
A
correlates with increased overall mortality, CSM and cancer recurrence. The authors hypothesised that this
may be caused by the suggested immunosuppressive effect of PBT. In a retrospective study, Buchner and
co-workers showed 5-year decreased CSS in cases where intra-operative blood transfusion (CSS decreased
from 67% to 48%) or post-operative blood transfusion (CSS decreased from 63% to 48%) were given [393].
2 Hammond and co-workers reviewed 20,762 cases of VTE after major surgery and found cystectomy patients
to have the second-highest rate of VTE among all cancers studied [394]. These patients benefit from
30 days low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that BMI > 30 and nonurothelial BCs are independently associated with VTE after cystectomy. In these patients extended (90 days)
heparin prophylaxis should be considered [378].

7.3.8
Survival
Of all cancers, bladder cancer ranks 13th in terms of mortality, with rates decreasing particularly in the most
developed countries [395].
Disease-free survival and OS in a large population-based study was 35% and 58% at ten years,
respectively [396]. However, the 5-year OS in node-positive patients who underwent cystectomy was 18% [397].
A systematic review including 57 studies (n = 30,293) assessed the long-term survical of patients treated with
trimodality therapy (TMT) and RC [396]. Ten-year OS was 30.9% and 35.1%, for TMT and RC, respectively with
a mean DSS of 50.9% for TMT and 57.8% for RC. For T2 disease, 10-year DSS was 69% and 78.9% for TMT
and RC, respectively and for T3/T4 disease 43.5% and 43.1% for TMT and RC, respectively. Three percent of
the patients (812 of 27,867) received NAC, resulting in 5-year OS and DSS in downstaged patients (< pT1) at
RC of 75.7% and 88.3%, respectively.
7.3.9
Impact of hospital and surgeon volume on treatment outcomes
In a systematic review including 40 retrospective studies with 56,000 patients, the impact of hospital and/
or surgeon volume and peri-operative outcomes of RC was assessed [398]. A higher hospital volume was
associated with lower in-hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality. In addition, higher volume hospitals were more
likely to have lower positive surgical margins, higher number of LNDs and neobladders and lower complication
rates. For surgeon volume, less evidence was available. This study suggested performing at least 10 RCs per
centre annually and preferably more than 20. Recently, a nationwide analysis of the Dutch Cancer Registry
including almost 9,500 patients between 2008 and 2018 reported decreased 30- and 90-day mortality rates for

36

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

annual hospital volumes of > 30 RCs. Furthermore, this study showed no true plateau curve for 30- and 90-day
mortality beyond 30 RCs supporting the ‘more is better’ principle [399, 400].
7.3.10

Summary of evidence and guidelines for radical cystectomy and urinary diversion

Summary of evidence
Higher RC hospital volume is associated with lower post-operative mortality rates and higher quality of
care.
Radical cystectomy includes removal of regional LNs.
There are data to support that extended vs. standard LND improves survival after RC.
No conclusive evidence exists as to the optimal extent of LND.
Ensuring that patients are well informed about the various urinary diversion options prior to making a
decision may help prevent or reduce decision regret, independent of the method of diversion selected.
The type of urinary diversion does not affect oncological outcome.
The use of extended VTE prophylaxis significantly decreases the incidence of VTE after RC.
In patients aged > 80 years with MIBC, cystectomy is an option.
Surgical complications of cystectomy and urinary diversion should be reported using a uniform
grading system. Currently, the best-adapted grading system for cystectomy is the Clavien Dindo
grading system.
Recommendations
Do not delay radical cystectomy (RC) for > 3 months as it increases the risk of progression
and cancer-specific mortality, unless the patient receives neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Perform at least 10, and preferably > 20, RCs per hospital/per year.
Before RC, fully inform the patient about the benefits and potential risks of all possible
alternatives. The final decision should be based on a balanced discussion between the
patient and the surgeon.
Do not offer an orthotopic bladder substitute diversion to patients who have an invasive
tumour in the urethra or at the level of urethral dissection.
Do not offer pre-operative bowel preparation.
Employ ‘Fast track’ measurements to reduce the time to bowel recovery.
Offer pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, such as low-molecular-weight heparin to RC
patients, starting the first day post-surgery, for a period of at least 4 weeks.
Offer RC to patients with T2–T4a, N0M0 disease or very high-risk non-muscle-invasive
bladder cancer.
Perform a lymph node dissection as an integral part of RC.

Palliative and salvage cystectomy

Unresectable locally-advanced tumours (T4b, invading the pelvic or abdominal wall) may be accompanied
by debilitating symptoms, including bleeding, pain, dysuria and urinary obstruction. These patients are
candidates for palliative treatments, such as palliative RT. If control of the symptoms is not possible by less
invasive methods, patients may be offered a palliative cystectomy with urinary diversion or urinary diversion
only. Palliative cystectomy carries the greatest morbidity, particularly in patients with a poor PS. In a series of
74 patients who underwent palliative cystectomy, severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade > 3) occurred in
30%. The 30-day mortality rate was 9% and at eight months follow-up, 70% had died [401].
In a retrospective single-centre analysis, Pieretti et al., grouped 265 patients into salvage
cystectomy post-TMT, primary cystectomy or primary cystectomy with prior history of non-TMT abdominal or
pelvic RT. Post-TMT salvage cystectomy was associated with a higher incidence of any late (HR: 2.3, p = 0.02)
and major late complications (HR: 2.1, p < 0.05) but there was no difference in DSS (p = 0.8) or OS (p = 0.9)
between the groups [402].

7.4.2
Supportive care
7.4.2.1
Obstruction of the upper urinary tract
Unilateral (best kidney) or bilateral nephrostomy tubes provide the easiest solution for UUT obstruction, but
patients find the tubes inconvenient and prefer ureteral stenting. However, stenting can be difficult to achieve.
Stents must be regularly replaced and there is the risk of stent obstruction or displacement. Another possible
solution is a urinary diversion with, or without, a palliative cystectomy.
7.4.2.2
Bleeding and pain
In the case of bleeding, the patient must be screened first for coagulation disorders or the patient’s use of
anticoagulant drugs must be reviewed. Transurethral (laser) coagulation may be difficult in a bladder full of
tumour or with a bleeding tumour. Intravesical rinsing of the bladder with 1% silver nitrate or 1–2% alum can
be effective [403]. This can usually be done without any anaesthesia. The instillation of formalin (2.5–4% for 30
minutes) is a more aggressive and painful procedure, requiring anaesthesia. Formalin instillation has a higher
risk of side-effects, e.g., bladder fibrosis, but is more likely to control the bleeding [403]. Vesicoureteral reflux
should be excluded to prevent renal complications.
Radiation therapy is another common strategy to control bleeding and is also used to control pain. An older
study reported control of haematuria in 59% of patients and pain control in 73% [404]. Irritative bladder
and bowel complaints due to irradiation are possible, but are usually mild. Non-conservative options are
embolisation of specific arteries in the small pelvis, with success rates as high as 90% [403]. Radical surgery is
a last resort and includes cystectomy and diversion (see above, Section 7.4.1).

7.5

Bladder-sparing treatments for localised disease

7.5.1
Transurethral resection of bladder tumour
Transurethral resection of bladder tumour alone in MIBC patients is only possible as a therapeutic option if
tumour growth is limited to the superficial muscle layer and if re-staging biopsies are negative for residual
(invasive) tumour [405]. In general, approximately 50% of patients will still have to undergo RC for recurrent
MIBC with a disease-specific mortality rate of up to 47% in this group [406]. A disease-free status at re-staging
TURB appears to be crucial in making the decision not to perform RC [407, 408]. A prospective study by
Solsona et al., including 133 patients after radical TURB and re-staging negative biopsies, reported a 15-year
follow-up [408]. Thirty per cent of patients had recurrent NMIBC and went on to intravesical therapy, and 30%
(n = 40) progressed, of which 27 died of BC. After five, ten, and fifteen years, the results showed CSS rates of
81.9%, 79.5%, and 76.7%, respectively and PFS rates with an intact bladder of 75.5%, 64.9%, and 57.8%,
respectively.
In conclusion, TURB alone should only be considered as a therapeutic option for muscle-invasive
disease after radical TURB, when the patient is unfit for cystectomy, or refuses open surgery, or as part of a
TMT bladder-preserving approach.

External beam radiotherapy
Current RT techniques with soft-tissue matching and image guidance result in superior bladder coverage and
a reduced integral dose to the surrounding tissues. The target total dose (to bladder and/or bladder tumour) for
curative EBRT in BC is 64–66 Gy [409, 410]. A reasonable alternative is moderately hypofractionated EBRT to
55 Gy in 20 fractions which has been suggested to be non-inferior to 64 Gy in 32 fractions in terms of invasive
locoregional control, OS, and late toxicity. In a phase II study, 55 patients (median age 86) with BC, unfit for
cystectomy or even daily RT, were treated with 6-weekly doses of 6 Gy [411]. Forty-eight patients completed
EBRT with acceptable toxicity and 17% showed local progression after two years demonstrating good local
control with this more ultra-hypofractionated schedule.
Elective treatment to the LNs is optional and should take into account patient comorbidities and the
risks of toxicity to adjacent critical structures. For node-positive disease, consider boosting grossly involved nodes
to the highest achievable dose that does not violate normal tissue constraints based on the clinical scenario.
The use of modern standard EBRT techniques results in major related late morbidity of the urinary
bladder or bowel in less than 5% of patients [412]. Acute diarrhoea is reduced even more with intensitymodulated RT [413]. Important prognostic factors for outcome include response to EBRT, tumour size,
hydronephrosis, presence of CIS, and completeness of the initial TURB. Additional prognostic factors reported
are age and stage [414].
With the use of modern EBRT techniques, efficacy and safety results seem to have improved over time. A 2002
Cochrane analysis demonstrated that RC has an OS benefit compared to RT [415], although this was not the
case in a 2014 retrospective review using a propensity score analysis [416].
In a 2017 retrospective cohort study of U.S. National Cancer Database data, patients over 80 were
identified with cT2–4, N0–3, M0 BC, who were treated with curative EBRT (60–70 Gy, n = 739) or concurrent
chemoradiotherapy (n = 630) between 2004 and 2013 [417]. The 2-year OS was 42% for EBRT vs. 56% for
chemoradiotherapy (p < 0.001). For EBRT a higher RT dose and a low stage were associated with improved OS.
In conclusion, although EBRT results seem to improve over time, EBRT alone does not seem to be as effective
as surgery or TMT therapy (see Section 7.5.4). Factors that influence outcome should be considered. However,
EBRT can be an alternative treatment in patients unfit for radical surgery or concurrent chemotherapy, and it
can also be effective in helping control bleeding.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy alone rarely produces durable complete remissions. In general, a clinical complete response
rate of up to 56% is reported in some series, which must be weighed against a staging error of > 60% [469,
470]. Response to chemotherapy is a prognostic factor for treatment outcome and eventual survival although it
may be confounded by patient selection [418].
Several groups have reported the effect of chemotherapy on resectable tumours (neoadjuvant approach), as
well as unresectable primary tumours [259, 276, 419, 420]. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with two to three cycles
of MVAC or CMV has led to a down-staging of the primary tumour in various prospective series [259, 276, 419].
A bladder-conserving strategy with TURB and systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been
reported several years ago and could lead to long-term survival with intact bladder in a highly selected patient
population [421].
A recent large retrospective analysis of a U.S. National Cancer Database cohort reported on 1,538
patients treated with TURB and multi-agent chemotherapy [422]. The two and 5-year OS for all patients was
49% and 32.9% and for cT2 patients it was 52.6% and 36.2%, respectively. While these data show that longterm survival with intact bladder can be achieved in a subset of patients it is not recommended for routine use.

7.5.4
Trimodality bladder-preserving treatment
Bladder preservation as an alternative to RC is generally reserved for patients with smaller solitary tumours,
negative nodes, no extensive or multifocal CIS, no tumour-related hydronephrosis, and good pre-treatment
bladder function. Trimodality bladder-preserving treatment should also be considered in all patients with a
contraindication for surgery, either a relative or absolute contraindication since the factors that determine
fitness for surgery and chemoradiotherapy differ.
Trimodality therapy combines TURB, chemotherapy and RT. The rationale to combine TURB with RT
is to achieve maximal local tumour control in the bladder and adjacent nodes. The addition of radiosensitising
chemotherapy or other radiosensitisers (mentioned below) is aimed at the potentiation of RT. Micrometastases
are targeted by platinum-based combination chemotherapy (for details see Section 7.1). The aim of TMT
is to preserve the bladder and QoL without compromising oncological outcome. There are no definitive
contemporary data supporting the benefit of using neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy combined with
chemoradiation. Patient selection is critical in achieving good outcomes [423]. Whether a node dissection
should be performed before TMT as in RC remains unclear [9, 10].
There are no successfully completed RCTs comparing the outcome of TMT with RC, but TMT using
chemoradiation has been shown to be superior to RT alone [424-426]. Many of the reported series have
differing characteristics as compared to the larger surgical series, which typically have median ages in the midto-late 60s compared to mid-70s for some large RT series (reviewed by James, et al. [424]).
In the case of TMT, two distinct patterns of care emerge; treatment aimed at patients fit for cystectomy who
elect TMT or refuse cystectomy, and treatment aimed at older, less fit, patients. For the former category, TMT
presents selective bladder preservation and in this case the initial step is a radical TURB where as much
tumour as possible should be resected. In this case appropriate patient selection (e.g., T2 tumours, no CIS) is
crucial [427, 428]. Even in case of an initial presumed complete resection, a second TUR has been suggested
to reveal tumour in > 50% of patients and subsequently improves 5-year OS in case of TMT [429]. For patients

who are not candidates for cystectomy, less stringent criteria can be applied, but extensive CIS and poor
bladder function should both be regarded as relative contraindications.
A collaborative review has described the principles of TMT [423]. For radiation, two schedules are most
commonly used; historically within the RTOG a split-course format with interval cystoscopy [425] and singlephase treatment which is now more commonly used [424]. A conventional radiation schedule includes EBRT
to the bladder and limited pelvic LNs with an initial dose of 40-45 Gy, with a boost to the whole bladder of
50–54 Gy and a further tumour boost to a total dose of 60–66 Gy. If not boosting the tumour, it is also
reasonable for the whole bladder to be treated to 59.4–66 Gy. For node-positive disease, consider boosting
grossly involved nodes to the highest achievable dose that does not violate normal tissue constraints.
Therefore, elective treatment to the LNs (when node negative) is optional and should take into account patient
comorbidities and the risks of toxicity to adjacent critical structures.
A reasonable radiation dosing alternative to conventional fractionation when treating the bladder-only fields is
moderately hypofractionated EBRT to 55 Gy in 20 fractions which has been suggested to be non-inferior to
64 Gy in 32 fractions in terms of invasive loco-regional control, OS and late toxicity [409, 430].
Different chemotherapy regimens have been used, but most evidence exists for cisplatin [431] and
mitomycin-C plus 5-FU [424]. In addition to these agents, other regimens have also been used such as
gemcitabine and hypoxic cell sensitisation with nicotinamide and carbogen, without clear preference for a
specific radiosensitiser [9, 10]. In a recently published phase II RCT, twice-a-day radiation plus 5-FU/cisplatin
was compared to once-daily radiation plus gemcitabine [432]. Both arms were found to result in a > 75% free
from distant metastases at 3 years (78% and 84%, respectively). Therefore, there are options for non-cisplatin
candidates such as 5-FU/mitomycin-C or low-dose gemcitabine.
Five-year CSS and OS rates vary between 50%–84% and 36%–74%, respectively, with salvage cystectomy
rates of 10–30% [423, 424, 427, 431, 433]. The Boston group reported on their experience in 66 patients with
mixed histological subtypes treated with TMT and found similar complete response, OS, DSS and salvage
cystectomy rates as in UC [434]. The majority of recurrences post-TMT are non-invasive and can be managed
conservatively [424]. In contemporary series, salvage cystectomy is required in about 10–15% of patients
treated with TMT and can be curative [424, 427, 433]. Current data suggest that major late complication rates
are slightly higher but remain acceptable for salvage- vs. primary cystectomy [435].
A meta-analysis of individual patient data from the BC2001 and BCON studies recently reported 10-year
follow-up results [409]. The authors conclude that moderately hypofractionated RT with 55 Gy in
20 fractions over 4 weeks should be the new standard of care for bladder-preserving management of MIBC.
The meta-analysis did not show a significant difference in late toxicity between fractionation regimens used and
no difference was observed in patient-reported HRQoL in the long term after recovery from acute toxicity in the
BC2001 trial. Published 5-year patient-reported outcomes showed excellent preservation of daily function with
both fractionation schedules throughout the follow-up period.
A sub-analysis of two RTOG trials looked at complete response (T0) and near-complete response (Ta or
Tis) after TMT [436]. After a median follow-up of 5.9 years 41/119 (35%) of patients experienced a bladder
recurrence, and fourteen required salvage cystectomy. There was no difference between complete and nearcomplete responders. Non-muscle-invasive BC recurrences after complete response to TMT were reported
in 25% of patients by the Boston group, sometimes over a decade after initial treatment [437]. A NMIBC
recurrence was associated with a lower DSS, although in properly selected patients, intravesical BCG could
avoid immediate salvage cystectomy.
The differential impact of RC vs. TMT on long-term OS is lacking a randomised comparison and rigorous
prospective data. A propensity score matched institutional analysis has suggested similar DSS and OS
between TMT and RC [433]. Two retrospective analyses of the U.S. National Cancer Database from 2004–2013
with propensity score matching compared RC to TMT. Ritch et al., identified 6,606 RC and 1,773 TMT patients
[438]. Worse survival was linked to higher age, comorbidity and tumour stage. After modelling, TMT resulted
in a lower mortality at one year (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74–0.96, p = 0.01). However, in years 2 and onwards,
there was a significant and persistent higher mortality after TMT (year 2: HR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2–1.6, p < 0.001;
and year 3 onwards: HR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2–1.8, p < 0.001). The second analysis was based on a larger cohort,
with 22,680 patients undergoing RC; 2,540 patients received definitive EBRT and 1,489 TMT [439]. Survival
after modelling was significantly better for RC compared to any EBRT, definitive EBRT and TMT (HR: 1.4,
95% CI: 1.2–1.6) at any time point. In general, such population-based studies are limited by confounding,

42

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

misclassification, and selection bias. A systematic review including 57 studies and over 30,000 patients
comparing RC and TMT found improved 10-year OS and DSS for TMT, but for the entire cohort OS and DSS
did not significantly differ between RC and TMT [396]. Complete response after TMT resulted in significantly
better survival, as did down-staging after TURB or NAC in case of RC.
Overall significant late pelvic (GI/genitourinary [GU]) toxicity rates after TMT are low and QoL is good [424, 440,
441]. A combined analysis of survivors from four RTOG trials with a median follow-up of 5.4 years showed
that combined-modality therapy was associated with low rates of late grade 3 toxicity (5.7% GU and 1.9%
GI). No late grade 4 toxicities or treatment-related deaths were recorded [440]. A retrospective study showed
QoL to be good after TMT and in most domains better than after cystectomy, although prospective validations
are needed [442]. One option to reduce side effects after TMT is the use of IMRT and image-guided RT
(IGRT) [9, 10, 443].
A bladder-preserving TMT strategy requires very close multidisciplinary cooperation [9, 10]. This was also
highlighted by a Canadian group [444]. In Ontario between 1994 and 2008 only 10% (370/3,759) of patients
with cystectomy had a pre-operative radiation oncology consultation, with high geographical variations.
Independent factors associated with this consultation included advanced age (p < 0.001), greater comorbidity
(p < 0.001) and earlier year of diagnosis (p < 0.001). A bladder-preserving TMT strategy also requires a high
level of patient compliance. Even if a patient has shown a clinical response to a TMT bladder-preserving
strategy, the bladder remains a potential source of recurrence, hence long-term life-long bladder monitoring is
essential and patients should be counselled that this will be required.

Consensus statement
Candidates for curative treatment, such as cystectomy or bladder preservation, should be clinically assessed

preservation is considered) and a neutral HCP such as a specialist nurse.
An important determinant for patient eligibility in case of bladder-preserving treatment is absence of

In case of bladder preservation with radiotherapy, combination with a radiosensitiser is always recommended
to improve clinical outcomes, such as cisplatin, 5-FU/MMC, carbogen/nicotinamide or gemcitabine.
Radiotherapy for bladder preservation should be performed with IMRT and IGRT to reduce side effects.
Dose escalation above standard radical doses to the primary site in case of bladder preservation, either by

Adjuvant therapy

7.6.1
Role of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy
Adjuvant chemotherapy after RC for patients with pT3/4 and/or LN positive (N+) disease without clinically
detectable metastases (M0) is still under debate [445, 446]. The general benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy
include:
•
chemotherapy is administered after accurate pathological staging, therefore, treatment in patients at low
risk for micrometastases is avoided;
•
no delay in definitive surgical treatment.
The drawbacks of adjuvant chemotherapy are:
•
assessment of in vivo chemosensitivity of the tumour is not possible and overtreatment is an unavoidable
problem;
•
delay of or intolerability to chemotherapy, due to post-operative morbidity [447].
There is limited evidence from adequately conducted and accrued phase III RCTs in favour of the routine use
of adjuvant chemotherapy [446, 448-453]. An individual patient data meta-analysis [503] of survival data from
six RCTs of adjuvant chemotherapy [454-458] included 491 patients (unpublished data from Otto et al., were
included in the analysis). All included trials suffered from significant methodological flaws including small
sample size (underpowered), incomplete accrual, use of inadequate statistical methods and design flaws
(irrelevant endpoints and failing to address salvage chemotherapy in case of relapse or metastases) [446]. In
these trials, three or four cycles of CMV, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and adriamycin (CISCA), methotrexate,
vinblastine, adriamycin or epirubicin, and cisplatin (MVA(E)C) and cisplatin with methotrexate (CM) were used
[459], and one trial used cisplatin monotherapy [457]. The data were not convincing to support an unequivocal
recommendation for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. In 2014, this meta-analysis was updated with an
additional three studies [450-452] resulting in the inclusion of 945 patients from nine trials [449]. None of the
trials had fully accrued and individual patient data were not used in the analysis [449]. For one trial only an
abstract was available at the time of the meta-analysis [451] and none of the included individual trials were
significantly positive for OS in favour of adjuvant chemotherapy. In two of the trials more modern chemotherapy
regimens were used (gemcitabine/cisplatin and paclitaxel/gemcitabine/cisplatin) [450, 451]. The HR for OS was
0.77 (95% CI: 0.59–0.99, p = 0.049) and for DFS 0.66 (95% CI: 0.45–0.91, p = 0.014) with a stronger impact on
DFS in case of nodal positivity. Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data from
RCTs in patients treated with adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy for MIBC was conducted [460]. In an
analysis of 10 RCTs (n = 1,183), an OS benefit was demonstrated for cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy
(HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.96, p = 0.02). This translates into an absolute improvement in survival of 6% at
5 years, from 50% to 56%, and a 9% absolute benefit when adjusted for age, sex, pT stage, and pN category
(HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65–0.92, p = 0.004). Adjuvant chemotherapy was also shown to improve RFS (HR: 0.71,
95% CI: 0.60-0.83, p < 0.001), locoregional RFS (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.55–0.85, p < 0.001), and MFS (HR: 0.79,
95% CI: 0.65–0.95, p = 0.01), with absolute benefits of 11%, 11%, and 8%, respectively.
A retrospective cohort analysis including 3,974 patients after cystectomy and LND showed an OS benefit in
high-risk subgroups (extravesical extension and nodal involvement) (HR: 0.75, CI: 0.62–0.90) [461]. A recent
publication of the largest RCT (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] 30994),
although not fully accrued, showed a significant improvement of PFS for immediate, compared with deferred,
cisplatin-based chemotherapy (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.4–0.73, p < 0.0001), but there was no significant OS
benefit [462].
Furthermore, a large observational study including 5,653 patients with pathological T3–4 and/
or pathological node-positive BC, treated between 2003 and 2006 compared the effectiveness of adjuvant
chemotherapy vs. observation. Twenty-three percent of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with a 5-year
OS of 37% for the adjuvant arm vs. 29.1% (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.64–0.76) in the observation group [463].
Another large retrospective analysis based on the U.S. National Cancer Database including 15,397 patients
with locally-advanced (pT3/4) or LN-positive disease also demonstrated an OS benefit in patients with UC
histology [464]. In patients with concomitant histological subtypes, however, no benefit was found.
Patients should be informed about potential chemotherapy options before RC and the limited evidence for
adjuvant chemotherapy.
7.6.2
Role of adjuvant immunotherapy
To determine the benefit of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, three phase III RCTs have evaluated checkpoint
inhibitor monotherapy with atezolizumab, nivolumab or pembrolizumab in patients with muscle-invasive UC.
The CheckMate 274 phase III multi-centre, double-blind, RCT of adjuvant nivolumab vs. placebo for up to

1 year in 709 patients with muscle-invasive UC with a high risk of recurrence (pathological stage pT3, pT4a,
or pN+) (neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy was allowed before trial entry) demonstrated a significant
improvement in median DFS (20.8 months [95% CI: 16.5–27.6] with nivolumab and 10.8 months [95%
CI: 8.3–13.9] with placebo). The percentage of patients who were alive and disease-free at 6 months
was 74.9% with nivolumab and 60.3% with placebo (HR for disease recurrence or death, 0.70; 98.22%
CI: 0.55–0.90; p < 0.001). Among patients with a PD-L1 expression level of > 1%, the percentage of patients
was 74.5% and 55.7%, respectively (HR: 0.55; 98.72% CI: 0.35–0.85; p < 0.001) [465].
The primary endpoint of DFS was not achieved in a multi-centre RCT of adjuvant atezolizumab vs.
observation in patients with ypT2–4a or ypN+ tumours following NAC or pT3–4a or pN+ tumours if no NAC was
received (IMvigor010). Median DFS was 19.4 months (95% CI: 15.9–24.8) with atezolizumab and 16.6 months
(11.2–24.8) with observation (stratified HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.74–1.08, p = 0.24) [466]. A similarly designed trial of
pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting has completed accrual with results awaited.
The FDA has approved nivolumab for adjuvant treatment of patients with UC who are at high risk of recurrence
after undergoing surgery [467] whereas the EMA has approved adjuvant nivolumab for the treatment of adults
with muscle-invasive UC (MIUC) with tumour cell PD-L1 expression > 1%, who are at high risk of recurrence
after undergoing radical resection of MIUC. A promising report (see Marker section) has suggested a potential
role for ctDNA to guide the use of adjuvant IO for UC [468].
7.6.3

Summary of evidence and guidelines for adjuvant therapy

Summary of evidence
Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy for high-risk patients (pT3, 4 and/or or N+ M0) without
neoadjuvant treatment can be associated with improvement in DFS and OS but trials are
underpowered to adequately answer this question.
To date, studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant setting in patients with high-risk
MIBC who have or have not received NAC have demonstrated conflicting results with the
CheckMate 274 study demonstrating an improvement in DFS with adjuvant nivolumab and the
IMvigor 010 study failing to show an improvement in DFS with adjuvant atezolizumab.
Circulating tumour DNA holds promise as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker to guide the use
of adjuvant IO for UC in patients who are at a high risk of recurrence and positive for ctDNA treated
with adjuvant atezolizumab demonstrating improved outcomes compared with observation.

Recommendations
Offer adjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy to patients with pT3/4 and/or
pN+ disease if no neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been given.
Offer adjuvant nivolumab to selected patients with pT3/4 and/or pN+ disease not eligible
for, or who declined, adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

7.7.1
Introduction
The treatment of metastatic UC had remained largely unchanged since pivotal trials published over 20 years
ago set the standard of care for first-line treatment with cisplatin-based combinations demonstrating an
OS benefit. In the past few years this long-standing paradigm has been challenged by several large studies
investigating the benefit of immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors. Moreover, novel compounds including
both targeted therapy and antibody-drug conjugates have been successfully tested and approved in later
treatment lines.
7.7.2
First-line systemic therapy for metastatic disease
In general, patients with untreated metastatic UC can be divided into three broad categories: fit for cisplatinbased chemotherapy, fit for carboplatin-based chemotherapy (but unfit for cisplatin) and unfit for any platinumbased chemotherapy.
Definitions: ‘Fit for cisplatin, fit for carboplatin, unfit for any platinum-based chemotherapy’
An international survey among BC experts [469] was the basis for a consensus statement on how to classify
patients unfit for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. At least one of the following criteria must be present: PS > 1;
GFR < 60 mL/min; grade > 2 audiometric hearing loss; grade > 2 peripheral neuropathy or New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class III heart failure [470]. Around 50% of patients with BC are not eligible for cisplatin-

based chemotherapy [470]. Renal function assessment is of utmost importance for treatment selection.
Measuring GFR with radioisotopes (99mTc DTPA or 51Cr-EDTA) is recommended in equivocal cases.
Cisplatin has also been administered in patients with a lower GFR (40–60 mL/min) using different
split-dose schedules. The respective studies were mostly small phase I and II trials in different settings
(neoadjuvant and advanced disease) demonstrating that the use of split-dose cisplatin is feasible and appears
to result in encouraging efficacy [468, 471, 472]. However, no prospective RCT has compared split-dose
cisplatin with conventional dosing.
Most patients that are deemed unfit for cisplatin are able to receive carboplatin-based chemotherapy. However,
some patients are deemed unfit for any platinum-based chemotherapy, i.e. both cisplatin and carboplatin.
Patient are unfit for any platinum-based chemotherapy in case of PS > 2, GFR < 30 mL/min or the combination
of PS 2 and GFR < 60 mL/min since the outcome in this patient population is poor regardless of platinumbased treatment or not [473]. Patients with multiple comorbidities may also be poor candidates for platinumbased chemotherapy. Definitions of platinum-eligibility for first-line treatment of metastatic UC are summarised
in Table 7.2.

7.7.2.1
First-line chemotherapy in patients fit for cisplatin
Cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy has been the standard of care since the late 1980s
demonstrating an OS of 12 to 14 months in different series (for a review see [474]). Methotrexate, vinblastine,
adriamycin plus cisplatin and GC achieved survival of 14.8 and 13.8 months, respectively [475]. Overall
response rates were 46% for MVAC and 49% for GC. The lower toxicity of GC [204] compared to standard
MVAC has resulted in GC becoming the standard regimen.
Dose-dense MVAC combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is less toxic and more
efficacious than standard MVAC in terms of, complete response (CR), and 2-year OS. However, there is
no significant difference in median survival between the two regimens [476, 477]. Further intensification
of treatment using paclitaxel, cisplatin and gemcitabine (PCG) triple regimen did not result in a significant
improvement in OS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population of a phase III RCT, comparing PCG to GC [478].
Similarly, the addition of the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab to GC did not result in OS improvement [479].
The disease sites have an impact on long-term survival. In LN-only disease, 20.9% of patients were alive at five
years compared to only 6.8% of patients with visceral metastases [475]. In the trials with long-term follow-up
approximately 10-15% of patients with metastatic UC are alive at 5 years and longer, suggesting a sustained
benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy in a minority of patients [475, 477].
Carboplatin-containing chemotherapy is not considered to be equivalent to cisplatin-based combinations, and
should not be considered interchangeable or standard in patients fit for cisplatin. A comparative analysis of
four randomised phase II trials of carboplatin vs. cisplatin combination chemotherapy demonstrated lower CR
rates and shorter OS for the carboplatin arms [480]. Recently, a retrospective study highlighted the importance
of applying cisplatin in cisplatin-eligible patients in order to maintain benefit [481].
7.7.2.2
First-line chemotherapy in patients fit for carboplatin (but unfit for cisplatin)
Up to 50% of patients are not fit for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy but most may be candidates
for carboplatin [470]. The first randomised phase II/III trial in this setting was conducted by the EORTC
and compared two carboplatin-containing regimens (methotrexate/carboplatin/vinblastine [M-CAVI] and

46

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

gemcitabine/carboplatin [GemCarbo]) in patients unfit for cisplatin. The EORTC definitions for eligibility were
GFR < 60 mL/min and/or PS 2. Severe acute toxicity was 13.6% with GemCarbo vs. 23% with M-CAVI,
while the ORR was 42% for GemCarbo and 30% for M-CAVI, respectively [473]. Based on these results the
combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine should be considered a standard of care in this patient group.
Combinations of gemcitabine and paclitaxel have been studied as first-line treatment and produced response
rates between 38% and 60% but has never been tested in RCTs [482-484]. A randomised phase II trial
assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of two vinflunine-based regimens (vinflunine/gemcitabine vs.
vinflunine/carboplatin). Both regimens showed equal ORR and OS with less haematologic toxicity for the
combination of vinflunine/gemcitabine [485]. Non-platinum combination chemotherapy is nevertheless not
recommended for first-line use in platinum-eligible patients.
The use of single-agent chemotherapy has been associated with varying response rates. Responses with
single agents are usually short, complete responses are rare, and no long-term DFS/OS has been reported. It is
not recommended for first-line treatment of metastatic UC.
7.7.2.3

Integration of immunotherapy in the first-line chemotherapy treatment of patients fit for platinum
(cisplatin or carboplatin)
7.7.2.3.1 Immunotherapy combination approaches
In 2020, the results of three phase III trials have been published investigating the use of immunotherapy in
the first-line setting for platinum-eligible patients. The first trial to report was IMvigor130 investigating the
combination of the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus platinum-gemcitabine chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy
plus placebo vs. atezolizumab alone [486]. The primary endpoint of PFS benefit for the combination vs.
chemotherapy alone in the ITT group was reached (8.2 months vs. 6.3 months [HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.96;
one-sided, p = 0.007]) while OS was not significant at the interim analysis after a median follow-up of
11.8 months. The small PFS benefit in the absence of an OS benefit has raised questions of its clinical
significance. Due to the sequential testing design, the comparison of chemotherapy vs. atezolizumab alone has
not yet been formally performed.
The KEYNOTE 361 study had a very similar design using the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab plus
platinum-gemcitabine vs. chemotherapy plus placebo vs. pembrolizumab alone. The results of the primary
endpoints of PFS and OS for the comparison of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy plus
placebo in the ITT population showed no benefit for the combination [487].
DANUBE compared the immunotherapy combination (IO-IO) of CTLA-4 inhibitor tremelimumab and
PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab with chemotherapy alone or durvalumab alone [488]. The co-primary endpoint of
improved OS for the IO-IO combination vs. chemotherapy was not reached in the ITT group nor was the OS
improved for durvalumab monotherapy vs. chemotherapy in the PD-L1-positive population.
In conclusion, these three trials do not support the use of combination of PD-1/L1 checkpoint
inhibitors plus chemotherapy or the IO-IO combination as first-line treatment.
7.7.2.3.2 Use of first-line single-agent immunotherapy in patients unfit for cisplatinum-based chemotherapy
Based on the results of two single-arm phase II trials [489, 490] the checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab
and atezolizumab have been approved by the U.S. FDA and the EMA for first-line treatment in cisplatinunfit patients in case of positive PD-L1 status. PD-L1 positivity for use of pembrolizumab is defined by
immunohistochemistry as a CPS of > 10 using the Dako 22C33 platform and for atezolizumab as positivity of
> 5% tumour-infiltrating immune cells using Ventana SP142.
Pembrolizumab was tested in 370 patients with advanced or metastatic UC ineligible for cisplatin,
showing an ORR of 29% and CR in 7% of patients [489]. Atezolizumab was evaluated in the same patient
population in a phase II trial (n = 119) showing an ORR of 23% with 9% of patients achieving CR [490].
The trials IMvigor 130, Keynote 361 and DANUBE all included an experimental arm with
immunotherapy alone using atezolizumab, pembrolizumab and durvalumab, respectively [486-488]. No benefit
in terms of PFS or OS for the use of single-agent immunotherapy compared to platinum-based chemotherapy
was found. The combination of carboplatin/gemcitabine therefore is considered the preferred first-line
treatment choice for patients ineligible for cisplatin but eligible for carboplatin.
7.7.2.3.3 Switch maintenance with immunotherapy after platinum-based chemotherapy
A randomised phase II trial evaluated switch maintenance treatment with pembrolizumab in patients achieving
at least stable disease on platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of PFS was met
(5.4 months vs. 3.0 months, HR: 0.65, p = 0.04) but not the secondary endpoint of OS (22 months vs. 18.7 months,
HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.52–1.59) [491].

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

47

The JAVELIN Bladder 100 study investigated the impact of switch maintenance with the PD-L1
inhibitor avelumab after initial treatment with platinum-gemcitabine chemotherapy. Patients achieving at
least stable disease or better after 4–6 cycles of platinum-gemcitabine were randomised to avelumab or
best supportive care (BSC). Overall survival was the primary endpoint which improved to 21.4 months with
avelumab compared to 14.3 months with BSC (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56–0.86; p < 0.001). Of patients who
discontinued BSC and received subsequent treatment 53% received immunotherapy. Immune-related AEs
occurred in 29% of all patients and 7% experienced grade 3 complications [492].
In conclusion, maintenance IO with avelumab is a standard of care for all patients with disease
stabilisation on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
7.7.2.4
Treatment of patients unfit for any platinum-based chemotherapy
Very limited data exist regarding the optimal treatment for this patient population which is characterised by
severely impaired PS (PS > 2) and/or severely impaired renal function (GFR < 30 mL/min). Historically, the
outcome in this patient group has been poor. Best supportive care has often been chosen instead of systemic
therapy. Most trials evaluating alternative treatment options to cisplatinum-based chemotherapy did not
focus specifically on this patient population thereby making interpretation of data difficult. The FDA (but not
EMA) has approved pembrolizumab and atezolizumab as first-line treatment for patients not fit to receive any
platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status based on the results of two single-arm phase II trials
[489, 490]. These trials have not reported how many patients were unfit for any platinum-based chemotherapy.
7.7.3
Second-line systemic therapy for metastatic disease
7.7.3.1
Second-line chemotherapy
Second-line chemotherapy data are highly variable and mainly derive from small single-arm phase II trials apart
from a single phase III RCT. A reasonable strategy has been to re-challenge former platinum-sensitive patients
if progression occurred at least six to twelve months after first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy.
A retrospective analysis of 296 patients within the the RISC cohort (Retrospective International Study of
Cancers of the Urothelium) revealed that subsequent platinum-based combination chemotherapy achieved a
somewhat higher disease control rate (57.4% vs. 44.8%, p.= 0.041) and OS (7.9 vs. 5.5 months, p = 0.035)
compared to subsequent non-platinum-based chemotherapy [493]. Second-line response rates of single-agent
treatment with paclitaxel (weekly), docetaxel, gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, ifosfamide, topotecan,
pemetrexed, lapatinib, gefitinib and bortezomib have ranged between 0% and 28% in small phase II trials
[494, 495].
The paclitaxel/gemcitabine combination has shown good response rates in small single-arm studies but no
adequate phase III RCT has been conducted [496, 497].
Vinflunine was tested in a phase III RCT and compared against BSC in patients progressing after
first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy [498]. The results showed a very modest ORR (8.6%),
a clinical benefit with a favourable safety profile and a survival benefit, which was however only statistically
significant in the eligible patient population (not in the ITT population).
A randomised phase III trial evaluated the addition of the angiogenesis inhibitor ramucirumab to
docetaxel chemotherapy vs. docetaxel alone, which resulted in improved PFS (4.1 vs. 2.8 months) and higher
response rates (24.5% vs. 14%) but no OS benefit was achieved [499, 500].
7.7.3.2
Second-line immunotherapy for platinum-pre-treated patients
The immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab have
demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in patients progressing during, or after, previous platinum-based
chemotherapy in phase I, II and III trials.
Pembrolizumab demonstrated a significant OS Improvement as second-line treatment in a phase III RCT
leading to EMA and FDA approval. Patients (n = 542) were randomised to receive either pembrolizumab
monotherapy or chemotherapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel or vinflunine). The median OS with pembrolizumab was
10.3 months (95% CI: 8.0–11.8) vs. 7.4 months (95% CI: 6.1–8.3) with chemotherapy (HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59–0.91,
p = 0.002) independent of PD-L1 expression levels [501].
Atezolizumab was the first checkpoint inhibitor approved by the FDA for metastatic UC based on the results of
phase I and II trials [236, 502] The phase III RCT (IMvigor211) included 931 patients comparing atezolizumab
with second-line chemotherapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel or vinflunine) did not meet its primary endpoint of
improved OS for patients with high PD-L1 expression with 11.1 months (atezolizumab) vs. 10.6 (chemotherapy)
months (stratified HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.63–1.21, p = 0.41) [503].

48

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

The PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab was approved by the FDA based on the results of a single-arm phase II trial
(CheckMate 275), enrolling 270 platinum pre-treated patients. The primary endpoint of ORR was 19.6%, and
OS was 8.74 months for the entire group [504].
Based on level 1 evidence from a RCT, pembrolizumab has emerged in clinic as the preferred standard of care
immunotherapy in the second-line setting.
7.7.3.3
Side-effect profile of immunotherapy
Checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies and CTLA-4 antibodies have a distinct side-effect
profile associated with their mechanism of action leading to enhanced immune system activity. These AEs
can affect any organ in the body leading to mild, moderate or severe side effects. The most common organs
affected are the skin, GI tract, liver, lung, thyroid, adrenal and pituitary gland. Other systems that may be
affected include musculoskeletal, renal, nervous, haematologic, ocular and cardiovascular system. Any change
during immunotherapy treatment should raise suspicion about a possible relation to the treatment. The nature
of immune-related AEs has been very well characterised and published [505]. The timely and appropriate
treatment of immune-related side effects is crucial to achieve optimal benefit from the treatment while
maintaining safety. Clear guidelines for side-effect management have been published [506]. Immunotherapy
treatment should be applied and supervised by trained clinicians only to ensure early side effect recognition
and treatment. In case of interruption of immunotherapy, re-challenge will require close monitoring for
AEs [507].
7.7.4
Integration of novel agents
7.7.4.1
Antibody drug conjugates
The first antibody drug conjugate to report encouraging data was enfortumab vedotin, an antibody-drug
conjugate targeting Nectin-4, a cell adhesion molecule which is highly expressed in UC conjugated to
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). A phase-II single-arm study (EV-201) in 125 patients previously treated
with platinum chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibition showed a confirmed objective response rate of 44%,
including 12% complete responses [508]. This data led to accelerated FDA and EMA approval for enfortumab
vedotin in locally-advanced or metastatic UC patients who previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor
and platinum-containing chemotherapy, as well as for cisplatin-ineligible patients who received one or more
prior lines of therapy [509, 510]. Another cohort of the same EV-201 trial demonstrated similar promising
results in a cohort of 91 patients that were cisplatin-ineligible and had received prior IO [511]. A phase III RCT
(n = 608) comparing enfortumab vedotin with single-agent chemotherapy after prior platinum chemotherapy
and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy demonstrated significant survival benefit of almost 4 months
(12.88 months vs. 8.97 months; HR 0.7, 95% CI: 0.56–0.89) [512]. The most common treatment-related AEs
included alopecia (45%), peripheral neuropathy (34%), fatigue (31%, 7.4% > grade 3), decreased appetite
(31%), diarrhoea (24%), nausea (23%) and skin rash (16%, 7.4% > grade 3).
The combination of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab as first-line treatment in 45 cisplatin-ineligible
patients with locally-advanced/metastatic UC demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate after a
median of nine cycles of 73.3% with a complete response rate of 15.6%. The median duration of response
and median OS were 25.6 months and 26.1 months, respectively. The most common treatment-related AEs
were peripheral sensory neuropathy (55.6%), fatigue (51.1%), and alopecia (48.9%) [513]. Based on these
results enfortumab vedotin has been FDA approved for patients who received prior platinum-containing
chemotherapy and prior IO with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor as well as for cisplatin-ineligible patients who received
one or more prior lines of therapy. An ongoing randomised phase III study is investigating the potential role for
the combination of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab in the first-line setting for patients with metastatic
disease (EV-302: NCT04223856).
Another new and also promising antibody drug conjugate is sacituzumab govitecan, consisting of a humanised
monoclonal antibody targeting trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) conjugated to SN-38, the active
metabolite of irinotecan. Sacituzumab govitecan was tested in 113 platinum and IO pre-treated metastatic UC
(mUC) patients [508] and achieved an ORR of 27% and a total of 77% had a decrease in measurable disease,
median PFS was 5.4 months and median OS 10.9 months [514]. Side effects consisted of haematological
toxicities (neutropenia 34% > grade 3; febrile neutropenia 10% > grade 3), fatigue (52%), alopecia (47%),
nausea (60%), diarrhea (65%, 10% > grade 3) and decreased appetite (36%) [514]. Sacituzumab govitecan has
received accelerated FDA approval for metastatic UC with prior platinum and IO pre-treatment. Several trials
using sacituzumab govitecan as monotherapy or in combination are ongoing.

7.7.4.2
FGFR inhibition
Genomic profiling of UC has revealed common potentially actionable genomic alterations including alterations
in FGFR [515]. Erdafitinib is a pan-FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and the first FDA-approved targeted therapy
for mUC with susceptible FGFR2/3 alterations following platinum-containing chemotherapy. The phase II trial of
erdafitinib included 99 patients whose tumour harboured an FGFR3 mutation or FGFR2/3 fusion and who had
disease progression following chemotherapy [234]. The confirmed ORR was 40% and an additional 39% of
patients had stable disease. A total of 22 patients had previously received immunotherapy with only one patient
achieving a response, yet the response rate for erdafitinib for this subgroup was 59%. At a median follow-up
of 24 months, the median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI: 4.0–6.0) and the median OS was 11.3 months (95%
CI: 9.7–15.2) [234]. Treatment-related AEs of > grade 3 occurred in 46% of patients. Common AEs of > grade 3
were hyponatraemia (11%), stomatitis (10%), and asthenia (7%) and 13 patients discontinued erdafitinib due
to AEs, including retinal pigment epithelial detachment, hand-foot syndrome, dry mouth, and skin/nail events.
In addition to erdafitinib, several other FGFR inhibitors are being evaluated including infigratinib which has
demonstrated promising activity [235]. In the recently published long-term follow up, the efficacy and safety
profile remained similar with no new safety signals with longer follow-up [516]. The increased identification of
FGFR3 mutations/fusion has led to several ongoing trials with different agents and combinations in different
disease settings.
7.7.5
Current status of predictive biomarkers
The most important advance in recent years has been the recognition of alterations in FGFR3 including
mutations and gene fusions as a predictive marker for response to FGFR inhibitors [234]. It is recommended to
screen mUC patients ideally at diagnosis of metastatic disease for FGFR3 alterations to plan optimal treatment
including trials.
Many efforts have focused on markers for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibition.
Programmed death-ligand 1 expression by immunohistochemistry has been evaluated in many studies with
mixed and, so far, inconclusive results. This may in part be related to the use of different antibodies and various
scoring systems evaluating different compartments i.e., tumour cells, immune cells, or both. A major limitation
of PD-L1 staining relates to the significant proportion of PD-L1-negative patients that respond to immune
checkpoint blockade. The predictive value of PD-L1 was not confirmed in large phase III trials evaluating
the integration of immunotherapy in the first-line setting for mUC [486-488]. At present, the only indication
for PD-L1 testing in mUC is dictated by current FDA and EMA approvals and relates to the potential use of
immune checkpoint inhibitors as first-line monotherapy in patients unfit for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.
Another biomarker that has been evaluated for predicting response to immunotherapy is high TMB [238].
Neoantigen burden and TMB have been associated with response to immune checkpoint blockade in several
malignancies. High TMB has been associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic
UC in small single-arm trials [236, 239] but was not confirmed so far in RCTs. Other markers that have been
evaluated in predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors include molecular subtypes, CD8 expression
by immunohistochemistry and other immune gene cell signatures. Recent work has focused on the importance
of stroma including the role of TGFs in predicting response to immune checkpoint blockade [242, 243].
In conclusion, apart from FGFR3 alterations, there are currently no further validated predictive
molecular markers that are routinely used in clinical practice.
7.7.6
Special situations
7.7.6.1
Impact of prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy on treatment sequence
Peri-operative systemic treatment is increasingly used in UC including cisplatin-based chemotherapy in
the neoadjuvant setting for BC and adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy for upper tract UC [517]. Many
ongoing phase III trials investigate the use of immunotherapy in this setting as well (see Section 7.6.2). So far,
one trial has reported a significant DFS benefit for adjuvant treatment with nivolumab compared with placebo
whereas one trial reported no significant benefit using atezolizumab vs. placebo in the same setting whilst
another trial reported negative findings [465, 466]. It is expected that an increased number of patients with
metastatic UC will have received pre-treatment with platinum and/or immunotherapy agents. No prospective
trials have investigated the treatment of such patients. The choice of treatment in these patients depends on
the applied peri-operative treatment and the time until relapse. If at least 12 months have passed since the end
of peri-operative treatment the same systemic treatment as in treatment-naive patients is recommended. To
help prevent early relapse within 12 months the peri-operative systemic therapy has to be taken into account
when planning further treatment.
7.7.6.2
Systemic treatment of metastatic disease with histology other than pure urothelial carcinoma
Pure UC represents the predominant histology in over 90% of patients with mUC. Variant histologies (e.g.

50

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

micropapillary, nested, sarcomatoid) and divergent differentiation (e.g., SCC, adenocarcinoma) can be found in
addition to pure UC in up to 33% of patients. Such patients were often excluded from large phase II and phase
III trials and therefore the knowledge about the best management of such patients is limited. The respective
literature was reviewed recently [69] and an expert Delphi survey and consensus conference provided guidance
[10]. In case of predominant pure UC it is recommended to treat patients with mixed histology the same way
as patients with a pure UC histology. Patients with predominant non-urothelial differentiation such as small cell
neuroendocrine carcinoma, urachal adenocarcinoma, SCC and adenocarcinoma should be treated individually.
7.7.7
Treatment of patients with bone metastases
The prevalence of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in patients with advanced/metastatic UC is 30–40% [518].
Interestingly, a recent report described several observations related to age- and sex-related differences in
the distribution of metastases in patients with metastatic BC and demonstrated that bone was the most
common metastatic site in men with other differences noted according to patient age and sex [519]. Skeletal
complications due to MBD have a detrimental effect on pain and QoL and are also associated with increased
mortality [520]. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid reduce and delay skeletal-related events (SREs)
due to bone metastases by inhibiting bone resorption, as shown in a small pilot study [521]. Denosumab, a
fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralises RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB
ligand), was shown to be non-inferior to zoledronic acid in preventing or delaying SREs in patients with solid
tumours and advanced MBD, including patients with UC [522]. Patients with MBD, irrespective of the cancer
type, should be considered for bone-targeted treatment [520].
Patients treated with zoledronic acid or denosumab should be informed about possible side effects including
osteonecrosis of the jaw and hypocalcaemia. Supplementation with calcium and vitamin D is mandatory.
Dosing regimens of zoledronic acid should follow regulatory recommendations and have to be adjusted
according to pre-existing medical conditions, especially renal function [523]. For denosumab, no dose
adjustments are required for variations in renal function.
7.7.8
Summary: treatment algorithm for metastatic urothelial cancer update 2021
Figure 7.2 summarises the treatment algorithm for metastatic BC based on the evidence discussed in the text
above.
Patients with treatment-naive mUC are grouped according to platinum-eligibility based on clear definitions.
In general, first-line treatment consists of platinum-based chemotherapy in which cisplatin is to be preferred
to carboplatin. Patients who are cisplatin-ineligible but carboplatin-eligible should receive gemcitabinecarboplatin combination chemotherapy. In case of positive PD-L1 status, treatment with checkpoint inhibitors
(atezolizumab or pembrolizumab) could be an alternative option.
Patients unfit for both cisplatin and carboplatin (platinum-unfit) can be considered for
immunotherapy (FDA approved irrespective of PD-L1 status, EMA approved only for PD-L1 positive patients) or
receive BSC.
In cases of disease stabilization on platinum-based chemotherapy switch, maintenance treatment with
IO (avelumab) is recommended. Alternatively, patients can be followed closely and receive second-line
immunotherapy at the time of progression (pembrolizumab).
It is recommended to determine FGFR mutation status before deciding about second-line
treatment. Patients with FGFR3 mutations are candidates for FGFR inhibitor treatment. Enfortumab vedotin
therapy is the new standard in case of progression after platinum chemotherapy and IO but has not yet been
approved in Europe. The optimal sequence of novel agents and potential combinations are the subject of many
ongoing trials. It is generally recommended to treat patients within ongoing clinical trials.
7.7.9

Summary of evidence and guidelines for metastatic disease

Summary of evidence
In a first-line setting, PS and the presence or absence of visceral metastases are independent
prognostic factors for survival.
In a second-line setting, negative prognostic factors are: liver metastasis, PS > 1 and low haemoglobin
(< 10 g/dL).
Cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy can achieve median survival of up to 14 months, with
long-term DFS reported in ~15% of patients with nodal disease and good PS.
Single-agent chemotherapy provides low response rates of usually short duration.

Carboplatin combination chemotherapy is less effective than cisplatin-based chemotherapy in terms
of complete response and survival.
There is no defined standard therapy for platinum chemotherapy-unfit patients with advanced or
metastatic UC.
Post-chemotherapy surgery after partial or complete response may contribute to long-term DFS in
highly selected patients.
Zoledronic acid and denosumab have been approved for supportive treatment in case of bone
metastases of all cancer types including UC, as they reduce and delay skeletal related events.
PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been approved for patients that have progressed during or after
previous platinum-based chemotherapy based on the results of a phase III trial.
Enfortumab vedotin after prior platinum chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has
demonstrated a significant survival benefit as compared to chemotherapy.
PD-1 inhibitor atezolizumab is approved for patients with advanced or metastatic UC unfit for
cisplatin-based chemotherapy in case of high PD-L1 expression defined as tumour-infiltrating immune
cells covering > 5% of the tumour area using the SP142 assay.
PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is approved for patients with advanced or metastatic UC unfit for any
platinum-based chemotherapy in case of high PD-L1 expression defined as CPS of > 10 using the
Dako 22C33 platform (EMA; FDA approval independent of PD-L1 status).
The combination of chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab or atezolizumab and the combination of
durvalumab and tremelimumab have not demonstrated OS survival benefit compared to platinumbased chemotherapy alone.
Switch maintenance with the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab has demonstrated significant OS benefit in
patients achieving at least stable disease on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

Recommendations
First-line treatment for platinum-fit patients
Use cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy with GC or HD-MVAC.
In patients unfit for cisplatin but fit for carboplatin, use the combination of carboplatin and
gemcitabine.
In patients achieving stable disease, or better, after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy,
use maintenance treatment with PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab.
First-line treatment in patients unfit for platinum-based chemotherapy
Consider checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab or atezolizumab in case of high PD-L1
expression (for definitions see text).
Second-line treatment
Offer checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab to patients progressing during, or after, platinumbased combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease.
Further treatment after platinum- and immunotherapy
Offer antibody drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin as monotherapy to patients with
advanced or metastatic UC pre-treated with platinum and immunotherapy.
Offer treatment in clinical trials testing novel drugs (e.g. sacituzumab govitecan); or in case

Quality of life

7.8.1
Introduction
The evaluation of HRQoL considers physical, psychological, emotional and social functioning. In patients with
MIBC, HRQoL is affected, particularly in the physical and social functioning domains [524, 525].
Several questionnaires have been validated for assessing HRQoL in patients with BC, including
FACT-G [526], EORTC QLQ-C30/BLM30 [527], SF-36 [528] and the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) [529]. In spite of
these validated questionnaires, there is heterogeneity in the measurements used to assess sexual health. A health
questionnaire that covers the entire range of sexual health in bladder cancer patients is currently lacking [530].
Regardless of the which questionnaire is used, assessment of the baseline and post-treatment
HRQoL is important. Questionnaires are helpful tools in clinical decision making, but, in addition, data support
the prognostic value of baseline HRQoL [531].

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

53

7.8.2
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Two RCTs including patiens undergoing NAC have published their HRQoL data [441, 532].
Huddart et al., analysed the subset of patients within the BC2001 trial who underwent NAC prior to
(chemo)radiation. Using the FACT-BL questionnaire, no detrimental impact of NAC on HRQoL was observed
[441]. Kitamura et al., reported on 64 patients included in the JCOG0209 study who underwent NAC (MVAC
vs. MVAC and RC). An overall decline on HRQoL was reported directly following NAC using the FACT-BL
questionnaire. However, no difference in HRQoL was observed after the consolidating RC.
7.8.3
Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion
Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses focused on HRQoL after RC and urinary diversion [356, 533].
Yang et al., compared HRQoL of incontinent and continent urinary diversions (all types) including
29 studies (n = 3,754) of which 9 had a prospective design (one of which was randomised) [356]. Only three
studies reported HRQoL data both pre- and post-operatively. All these three studies reported an initial
deterioration in overall HRQoL but general health, functional and emotional domains at 12 months post-surgery
were equal or better than baseline. Overall, no difference in HRQoL between continent and incontinent urinary
diversion was reported although an ileal conduit may confer a small physical health benefit [533].
Cerruto et al., reported HRQoL comparing ileal conduit with orthotopic neobladder reconstruction
[533]. A pooled analysis was performed including 18 studies (n = 1,553) of which the vast majority were
retrospective studies. Although this study was hampered by methodological limitations, no statistical significant
difference in overall HRQoL was found.
Altogether, there appears to be no superior type of urinary diversion in terms of overall HRQoL but it is rather a
result of proper patient selection. An older and isolated patient is probably better served with an ileal conduit,
whereas a younger patient with a higher level of interest in body image and sexuality is better off with an
orthotopic diversion. The patient’s choice is the key to the selection of reconstruction method [356].
A number of RCTs comparing ORC with RARC (with either intra- or extracorporeal urinary diversion) have
reported their HRQoL data [343, 379, 534, 535]. All studies reported no statistical significant difference in
HRQoL outcomes between surgical techniques.
7.8.4
Bladder-sparing trimodality therapy
The only HRQoL data in bladder sparing treatment collected in a RCT setting was published by Huddart et al.
[441]. The primary endpoint was the change in the Bladder Cancer Subscale (BLCS), as part of the FACT-BL
questionnaire, at one year post-treatment. Questionnaire return rate at one and five years was 70% and 60%,
respectively. A reduction in HRQoL was seen in the majority of the domains immediately following RT, however,
in most patients the HRQoL scores returned to baseline 6 months after RT and maintained at this level for five
years. Approximately 33% of patients reported persistent lower Bladder Cancer Subscale scores after five
years. Addition of chemotherapy did not affect the HRQoL outcomes.
7.8.5
Non-curative or metastatic bladder cancer
In non-curative or metastatic BC, HRQoL is reduced because of associated micturition problems, bleeding,
pain and therefore disturbance of social and sexual life [536]. Beneficial impact of palliative surgery [537],
RT [538], and/or chemotherapy on bladder-related symptoms have been described [539].
A HRQoL analysis was performed in platinum-refractory patients who were randomised to pembrolizumab
vs. another line of chemotherapy (KEYNOTE-45 trial) [540]. It was reported that patients treated with
pembrolizumab had stable or improved global health status/QoL, whereas those treated with investigators’
choice of chemotherapy experienced declines in global health [540].
Recently, HRQoL data was presented from cohort 1 of the EV-201 study including 125 patients treated with
enfortumab vedotin after failing previous treatment with platinum chemotherapy and anti–PD-1/L1 therapy
[541]. Patients who remained on enfortumab vedotin treatment showed no detoriation in HRQoL. In patients
with bone metastases at baseline, pain control and possibly pain reduction was observed.
7.8.6

Summary of evidence and recommendations for health-related quality of life

Summary of evidence
Compared to non-cancer controls, the diagnosis and treatment of BC has a negative impact on
HRQoL.
There is no distinct difference in overall QoL between patients with continent or incontinent diversion.

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

In patients with MIBC treated with RC, overall HRQoL declines immediately after treatment and
recovers to baseline at 12 months post-operatively in most patients.
In patients with MIBC treated with RT, overall HRQoL declines immediately after treatment,
and recovers to baseline at 6 months post-treatment.
HRQoL data are comparable for RARC (with either intracorporeal or extracorporeal urinary diversion)
and ORC.
In patients with MIBC treated with RT, concomitant chemotherapy or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has
no significant impact on HRQoL.
In patients with platinum-refractory advanced UC, pembrolizumab may be superior in terms of HRQoL
compared to another line of chemotherapy.
Recommendations
Use validated questionnaires to assess health-related quality of life in patients with muscleinvasive bladder cancer, both at baseline and post-treatment.
Discuss the type of urinary diversion taking into account a patient preference, existing
comorbidities, tumour variables and coping abilities.

An appropriate schedule for disease monitoring should be based on natural timing of recurrence; probability
and site of recurrence; functional monitoring after urinary diversion and the potential available management
options [542].
Nomograms on CSS following RC have been developed and externally validated, but their wider
use cannot be recommended until further data become available [543, 544].
Current surveillance protocols are based on patterns of recurrence drawn from retrospective series
only. Combining this data is not possible since most retrospective studies use different follow-up regimens and
imaging techniques. Additionally, reports of asymptomatic recurrences diagnosed during routine oncological
follow-up and results from retrospective studies are contradictory [545-547]. From the Volkmer B, et al.,
series of 1,270 RC patients, no differences in OS were observed between asymptomatic and symptomatic
recurrences [546]. Conversely, in the Giannarini, et al., series of 479 patients; those with recurrences detected
during routine follow-up (especially in the lungs) and with secondary urothelial tumours as the site of
recurrence, had a slightly higher survival [545]. Boorjian, et al., included 1,599 RC patients in their series, with
77% symptomatic recurrences. On multivariate analysis, patients who were symptomatic at recurrence had a
60% increased risk of death as compared to asymptomatic patients [547].
However, at this time, no data from prospective trials demonstrating the potential benefit of early
detection of recurrent disease and its impact on OS are available [548].

8.2

Site of recurrence

8.2.1
Local recurrence
Local recurrence takes place in the soft tissues of the original surgical site or in LNs. Contemporary cystectomy
has a 5–15% probability of pelvic recurrence which usually occurs during the first 24 months, most often
within 6 to 18 months after surgery. However, late recurrences can occur up to five years after RC. Risk factors
described are pathological stage, LNs, positive margins, extent of LND and peri-operative chemotherapy [549].
Patients generally have a poor prognosis after pelvic recurrence. Even with treatment, median
survival ranges from four to eight months following diagnosis. Definitive therapy can prolong survival, but
mostly provides significant palliation of symptoms. Trimodality management generally involves a combination
of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery [548].
8.2.2
Distant recurrence
Distant recurrence is seen in up to 50% of patients treated with RC for MIBC. As with local recurrence,
pathological stage and nodal involvement are risk factors [550]. Systemic recurrence is more common in
locally-advanced disease (pT3/4), ranging from 32 to 62%, and in patients with LN involvement (range 52–70%)
[551].
The most likely sites for distant recurrence are LNs, lungs, liver and bone. Nearly 90% of distant
recurrences appear within the first three years after RC, mainly in the first two years, although late recurrence

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

55

has been described after more than 10 years. Median survival of patients with progressive disease treated
with platinum-based chemotherapy is 9–26 months [552-554]. However, longer survival (28–33% at 5 years)
has been reported in patients with minimal metastatic disease undergoing TMT management, including
metastasectomy [555, 556].
8.2.3
Urothelial recurrences
After RC, the incidence of new urethral tumours was 4.4% (1.3–13.7%). Risk factors for secondary urethral
tumours are urethral malignancy in the prostatic urethra/prostate (in men) and bladder neck (in women).
Orthotopic neobladder was associated with a significant lower risk of urethral tumours after RC (OR: 0.44) [557].
There is limited data, and agreement, about urethral follow-up, with some authors recommending routine
surveillance with urethral wash and urine cytology and others doubting the need for routine urethral surveillance.
However, there is a significant survival advantage in men with urethral recurrence diagnosed asymptomatically
vs. symptomatically, so follow-up of the male urethra is indicated in patients at risk of urethral recurrence [548].
Treatment is influenced by local stage and grade of urethral occurrence. In urethral CIS, BCG instillations have
success rates of 83% [558]. In invasive disease, urethrectomy should be performed if the urethra is the only site
of disease; in case of distant disease, systemic chemotherapy is indicated [3].
Upper urinary tract UCs occur in 4–10% of cases and represent the most common sites of late recurrence
(3-year DFS following RC) [559]. Median OS is 10–55 months, and 60–67% of patients die of metastatic disease
[548]. A meta-analysis found that 38% of UTUC recurrence was diagnosed by follow-up investigations, whereas
in the remaining 62%, diagnosis was based on symptoms. When urine cytology was used during surveillance,
the rate of primary detection was 7% vs. 29.6% with UUT imaging. The meta-analysis concluded that patients
with non-invasive cancer are twice as likely to have UTUC as patients with invasive disease [560]. Multifocality
increases the risk of recurrence by three-fold, while positive ureteral or urethral margins increase the risk by
seven-fold. Radical nephroureterectomy can prolong survival [561].

8.3

Time schedule for surveillance

Although, based on low level evidence only, some follow-up schedules have been suggested, guided by the
principle that recurrences tend to occur within the first years following initial treatment. A schedule suggested
by the EAU Guidelines Panel includes a CT scan (every 6 months) until the third year, followed by annual
imaging thereafter. Patients with multifocal disease, NMIBC with CIS or positive ureteral margins are at
higher risk of developing UTUC, which can develop late (> 3 years). In those cases, monitoring of the UUT is
mandatory during follow-up. Computed tomography is to be used for imaging of the UUT [560].
The exact time to stop follow-up is not well known and recently a risk-adapted schedule has been proposed,
based on the interaction between recurrence risk and competing health factors that could lead to individualised
recommendations and may increase recurrence detection. Elderly and very low-risk patients (those with
NMIBC or pT0 disease at final cystectomy report) showed a higher competing risk of non-BC mortality when
compared with their level of BC recurrence risk. On the other hand, patients with locally-advanced disease or
LN involvement are at a higher risk of recurrence for more than 20 years [562]. However, this model has not
been validated, does not differentiate between pure UC or variant histologies, and does not incorporate several
risk factors related to non-BC mortality. Variant histology tumours (including urothelial variants, non-urothelial
variants, and mixed variants) might be associated with a greater recurrence risk than pure UC. Recently, a
different follow-up scheme for patients with variant histology tumours has been proposed [563]. In case of
pT0 patients with previous variant histology in TURB or in those in the age range between 60 and 79 years,
the follow-up should be longer than in pure UC since the risk of recurrence persists over time. Similar to pure
UC, patients older than 80 years with variant histology tumours might not need oncologic surveillance given
the higher risk of non-BC mortality compared to the risk of recurrence whereas patients younger than 60 years
should be offered extended surveillance (> 10 years) since the risk of recurrence will exceed that of non-BC
mortality [563]. Future prospective studies are needed to answer the question whether a more intense followup for variant histologies should be considered.
Furthermore, the prognostic implications of the different sites of recurrence should be considered. Local and
systemic recurrences have a poor prognosis and early detection of the disease will not influence survival
[564]. Despite this, the rationale for a risk-adapted schedule for BC surveillance appears to be promising and
deserves further investigation.
Since data for follow-up strategies are sparse, a number of key questions were included in a
recently held consensus project [9, 10]. Outcomes for all statements for which consensus was achieved are
listed in Section 8.6.

MUSCLE-INVASIVE AND METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER - LIMITED UPDATE MARCH 2023

8.4

Follow-up of functional outcomes and complications

Apart from oncological surveillance, patients with a urinary diversion need functional follow-up. Complications
related to urinary diversion are detected in 45% of patients during the first five years of follow-up. In a series of
131 patients, this rate increased to 94% in those surviving > 15 years [565].
General functional complications are diverse and include: vitamin B12 deficiency, metabolic acidosis,
worsening of renal function, urinary infections, urolithiasis and ureteroenteric stricture [566]. Benign
ureteroenteric strictures may occur in up to 20% of patients [566]. Based on SEER data, cystectomy was found
to be associated with a 21% increased risk of fractures compared to no RC due to chronic metabolic acidosis
and subsequent long-term bone loss [564]. Since low vitamin B12 levels have been reported in 17% of patients
with bowel diversion, in case of cystectomy and bowel diversion, vitamin B12 levels should be measured
annually [9, 10, 567]. In a series of 3,360 patients who underwent RC for MIBC, 29% progressed to advanced
chronic kidney disease within 12 months [568]
In a retrospective study comparing various forms of intestinal diversion, ileal conduits had fewer
late complications than continent abdominal pouches or orthotopic neobladders [567]. The main longterm complications in ileal conduit patients are stomal complications in up to 24% and functional and/or
morphological changes of the UUT in up to 30% of patients [567, 569, 570]. At 15 years of follow-up, 50% of
patients developed UUT changes and 38% developed urolithiasis [571].
The main specific complications in patients with a neobladder are continence problems and emptying
dysfunction [548]. Clifford et al., prospectively evaluated continence outcomes in male patients undergoing
orthotopic neobladder diversion [572]. Day-time continence increased from 59% at less than three months
post-operatively to 92% after 12 to 18 months. Night-time continence increased from 28% at less than three
months post-operatively to 51% after 18 to 36 months. Also of interest is the urinary bother in females with
an orthotopic neobladder. Bartsch and co-workers reported day-time and night-time continence rates of
70.4% and 64.8%, respectively, in 56 female neobladder patients. Emptying disfunction is especially common
in women: approximately two-thirds need to catheterise their neobladder, while almost 45% do not void
spontaneously at all [573]. There seems to be a correlation between voiding patterns and nerve preservation;
in 66 women bilateral preservation of autonomic nerves decreased the need for catheterisation to between
3.4–18.7% (CI: 95%) [574].
In a single-centre series of 259 male patients, long-term follow-up after orthotopic bladder
substitution (median 121 months [range 60–267]), showed that excellent long-term functional outcomes can be
achieved in high-volume centres with dedicated teams [575].

After radical cystectomy with curative intent, follow-up of the urethra with cytology and/or cystoscopy is
recommended in selected patients (e.g., multifocality, carcinoma in situ and tumour in the prostatic urethra).
After trimodality treatment with curative intent, follow-up for the detection of relapse is recommended every
3–4 months initially; then after 3 years, every 6 months in the majority of patients.
After trimodality treatment with curative intent, regular cystoscopic evaluation of the bladder wall is needed.
After trimodality treatment with curative intent, follow-up imaging with CT of thorax and abdomen to assess
distant recurrence or recurrence outside the bladder is needed.
In patients with a partial or complete response after chemotherapy for metastatic urothelial cancer, regular
follow-up is needed. Imaging studies may be done according to signs/symptoms.
In patients treated with radical cystectomy with curative intent and who have a neobladder, management of
acid bases household includes regular measurements of pH and sodium bicarbonate substitution according
to the measured value.
To detect relapse after radical cystectomy with curative intent, a CT of the thorax and abdomen is
recommended up to five years post-operatively.
Vitamin B12 levels have to be measured annually in the follow-up of patients treated with radical cystectomy
and bowel diversion with curative intent.
