Incidence and epidemiology
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a relatively uncommon subtype
of lymphoid malignancy and represents 5%–7% of malignant
lymphoma in Western Europe. The annual incidence of this disease has increased during recent decades to 1–2/100 000 recently.
MCL is more common in males than in women with a 3 : 1 ratio.

Diagnosis and pathology/molecular biology
Diagnosis should be based on a surgical specimen, preferably a
lymph node biopsy. Core biopsies should only be carried out in
patients without easily accessible lymph nodes (e.g. retroperitoneal bulk), keeping in mind the heterogeneity of MCL. In the rare
cases with leukaemic manifestation only, a bone marrow (BM)
biopsy may be sufficient if additional diagnostic measures are
applied, immunophenotype (CD5þ, CD19/20þ), detection of
t(11;14)(q13;q32) and overexpression of cyclin D1. Fine needle
aspirations are inappropriate for a reliable evaluation of additional risk factors (cytology, cell proliferation).
The histological report should give the diagnosis according to
the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and Ki-67
as the most established histomorphological risk factor [I, A] [1].
Most tumours have a classic morphology of small-medium sized
cells with irregular nuclei. However, the malignant lymphocytes
may present with a spectrum of morphological variants, including small round (resembling chronic lymphocytic leukaemia),

marginal zone-like, pleomorphic and blastoid cells. In the
updated WHO classification, a leukaemic non-nodal subtype has
been characterised based on the clinical presentation usually with
a more indolent clinical course [1]. As only the minority of these
cases is correctly diagnosed based on classical histology only, review by an expert haematopathologist is advised. In particular,
additional immunohistochemistry for detection of cyclin D1
overexpression is mandatory.
In the rare cyclin D1-negative cases, detection of SOX11 may
help to establish the diagnosis [2].
If possible, additional biopsy material should be stored freshly
frozen to allow additional molecular analyses (currently still
investigational).

Staging and risk assessment
Since treatment may differ depending on the stage of the disease,
initial staging should be thorough, particularly in the rare cases
with non-bulky stages I and II (Table 1). Initial work-up should
include a computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck, thorax,
abdomen and pelvis, and a BM aspirate and biopsy (Table 2).
Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan is especially recommended in the rare limited stages I/II, before localised radiotherapy (RT) [IV, C]. Gastrointestinal endoscopy is also
recommended in these rare cases to detect asymptomatic involvement but otherwise only in symptomatic patients. Of note, when

For each prognostic factor, 0–3 points were given to each patient and
points were summed up to a maximum of 11. Patients with 0–3 points
in summary were classiﬁed as low-risk, patients with 4 to 5 points as
intermediate-risk, and patients with 6–11 points as high-risk. ECOG
performance status was weighted with 2 points if patients were unable
to work or bedridden (ECOG 2–4). LDH was weighted according to the
ratio to the ULN. Thus, for an ULN of 240 U/L, the limits were 180, 240
and 360 U/L for low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, respectively.

carried out according to the Lugano classification system
(Table 1), with mention of bulky disease > 5 cm when appropriate [4].
The evaluation of the cell proliferation antigen Ki-67 is the
most applicable method to evaluate cell proliferation, and is considered the most established biological risk factor in MCL. As the
reproducibility of quantitative scores among pathologists may
vary, a standardised method has been suggested [5].
For prognostic purposes, a combined MCL International
Prognostic Index (MIPI-c) (Table 3; web-based calculator: www.
european-mcl.net/de/clinical_mipi.php) has been established
[I, A] [6, 7].

Leukaemic non-nodal subtype of MCL
Most patients with MCL follow an aggressive clinical course.
However, a subset of patients may exhibit a more indolent evolution. Most of these cases are commonly characterised by a leukaemic non-nodal presentation with BM involvement only and
splenomegaly [1, 8]. SOX11 negativity may help to identify these
cases. In addition, conventional MCL (SOX11-positive) with low
Ki-67 ( 10%) tend to have a more indolent course. However,
additional TP53 mutations may cause an aggressive clinical evolution (Figure 1) [9].
Unfortunately, there are no markers that definitely predict indolent behaviour, but a short course of ‘watch and wait’ period
under close observation seems to be appropriate in suspected indolent cases with low tumour burden [III, B] [10].

If treatment is required, recommendations for classical MCL
apply.

Treatment
First-line
Stages I–II. In the small proportion of patients with limited nonbulky stages I–II, RT (involved field, 30–36 Gy) has been suggested to achieve long-term remissions [11]. In contrast, in a
randomised study, all patients with early-stage MCL relapsed
within 1 year [12]. Thus, a shortened conventional chemotherapy
(ChT) induction followed by consolidation RT (similar to diffuse
large cell lymphoma) may be the most appropriate treatment in
these cases [IV, B].
In stage I–II patients with large tumour burden or adverse
prognostic features, systemic therapy as indicated for advanced
stages should be applied; consolidation RT may be considered depending on tumour location and expected side-effects [IV, B].
Stages III–IV
Induction: In all symptomatic patients and generally in
cases with high tumour burden, therapy should be initiated at
diagnosis [I, A]. The current therapeutic approach is based
on clinical risk factors, symptoms and patient characteristics
(Figure 2).
Elderly patients: Based on a median age of 65 years at first diagnosis, the majority of patients do not qualify for dose-intensified

regimens. Three prospective first-line trials, a salvage trial and a
systematic meta-analysis support an improved overall response,
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) if rituximab was added to ChT (Table 4) [I, A] [13].
Rituximab in combination with ChT such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) or
bendamustine should be used [I, B] [14–16]. Recently, a combination with bortezomib achieved almost doubled median PFS
but resulted in significant thrombocytopaenia [17]. Rituximab
in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (R-CVP) resulted in inferior response rates and PFS
[18]. Purine analogue-based schemes, rituximab with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC) or with fludarabine and
mitoxantrone (R-FM), are also discouraged due to early failures
and long-lasting myelosuppression [I, D] [15]. The addition of
high-dose cytarabine (HD-AraC) to CHOP is currently being
tested in elderly patients. Recently, rituximab, bendamustine
and cytarabine (R-BAC) has been explored also in first-line
therapy [19].
In frail patients, a less intense immunochemotherapy,
chlorambucil or vincristine, doxorubicin, oral dexamethasone and chlorambucil (VADC) or prednisone, etoposide,
procarbazine and cyclophosphamide (PEP-C) may be considered, aiming primarily at palliation [II, B]. However, targeted therapy exhibiting a low toxicity profile might be used
in this population [20].
Antibody monotherapy [rituximab, radioimmunotherapy
(RIT)] achieves only moderate response rates and is therefore not
recommended [III, B] [21].

In patients with positive hepatitis B serology, prophylactic
antiviral medication and/or virus load monitoring is strongly recommended [I, A] [22].
Consolidation/maintenance. Rituximab maintenance significantly
improves PFS and OS after rituximab and CHOP (R-CHOP)
[I, A] and PFS in a systematic meta-analysis [15, 23].
RIT consolidation also prolongs PFS after ChT, but its benefit
seems to be inferior in comparison to rituximab maintenance
[II, B] [24].
Younger patients: Although no curative treatment is available
for MCL so far, an intensive approach, e.g. by autologous stem
cell transplantation (ASCT), has been demonstrated to induce
higher response and survival rates in fit patients, independently
of the addition of rituximab [I, B] (Table 5) [25–27].

Volume 28 | Supplement 4 | August 2017

In addition, a randomised trial confirmed that a cytarabinecontaining induction achieves a significantly improved median
time to treatment failure (P ¼ 0.038) [I, B] [28]. In contrast, an
induction-based on HD-AraC alone achieves only insufficient response rates [III, D] [29].
In a retrospective study comparison of the Nordic, HOVON
and MCL Younger protocols, total body irradiation (TBI) before
ASCT was confirmed to be beneficial only in partial response
(PR) patients [II, B] [30]. In contrast, the benefit of RIT has not
been demonstrated in inter-study comparisons.
An upfront dose-intensified approach (R-hyper-CVAD, rituximab in combination with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone alternating
with high-dose methotrexate/cytarabine cycles) also achieved
very high response and survival rates in phase II studies, but
its feasibility is hampered by a significant therapy-associated

toxicity [II, C] [31–33] and low success rate of stem cell
mobilisation.
Rituximab maintenance following a rituximab with dexamethasone, cytarabine and cisplatin (R-DHAP)-based induction
and ASCT improves PFS and OS and represents the current
standard of care [I, A] [27].
So far, there are no data to support the application of allogeneic
stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) as part of front-line treatment
[II, D] [34].

Relapsed disease
A repeated biopsy is recommended to identify important prognostic features of MCL.
Selection of salvage treatment depends on efficacy of
prior regimens. In early relapses (< 12–24 months), a noncross-resistant scheme should be preferred [bendamustine or
HD-AraC-containing regimens, e.g. rituximab, bendamustine
and cytarabine (R-BAC)] after CHOP or vice versa [19].
Rituximab should be added if the previous antibodycontaining scheme achieved > 6 months duration of remission
[IV, B].
In cases of early relapses or in refractory cases, newer targeted approaches should be strongly considered (Figure 2;
Table 6). Among the registered compounds, ibrutinib achieves
the highest response rates and, in some cases, long-term remissions [35–37], but early relapses display very aggressive features. When there are contraindications to ibrutinib therapy,
particularly a high risk of bleeding, lenalidomide (preferable
in combination with rituximab) may also achieve ongoing remissions in some cases [38–41]. Temsirolimus and bortezomib have been shown to be effective but should preferably be

applied in combination with ChT based on phase II/III studies
[17, 42–45].
Rituximab maintenance has a favourable safety profile and
prolongs PFS and OS in relapsed disease [I, A] [46]. However,
second-line maintenance approaches have not been investigated
in patients relapsing after front-line maintenance [IV, D].
RIT consolidation seems to result in extended remission durations [47, 48] especially in elderly patients with comorbidities
not eligible for dose intensification [IV, B].
High-dose ChT with ASCT may be considered in patients
relapsed after conventional first-line therapy. However, the benefit seems to be marginal in this setting [49], and there is no role
for a second autograft at relapse.
In younger patients, alloSCT is potentially curative and
has achieved long-term remissions even in patients following
early relapse and with refractory disease [III, B]. Based on
the advanced age of most patients, dose-reduced conditioning
is appropriate [IV, B] [50]. Haploidentical BM transplantation achieves high response rates but is still experimental in
MCL.

Response evaluation
PET-CT according to the Lugano classification for response
evaluation is optional [4].
Radiological tests should be carried out mid- and postcompletion of ChT. Patients who achieve less than a PR should
be considered for early salvage regimens. Patients achieving a PR
may convert to a complete response after post-induction
treatment.
The independent prognostic role of minimal residual disease
(MRD) applying patient-specific primers has been confirmed in
numerous studies [51, 52]. However, because of the current

Personalised medicine
In this disease setting, more research is needed to identify molecular markers, which could translate into a more personalised
approach.

Table 8. Summary of recommendations
Diagnostic procedures include histomorphology by an expert haematopathologist, immunophenotype (CD5þ, CD19/20þ), Ki-67 staining and mandatory detection of cyclin D1 overexpression or t(11;14)(q13;q32)
Clinical and biological prognosticators (MIPI-c) should be applied in clinical
routine to estimate the clinical behaviour
In localised stages: discuss conventional ChT followed by RT (30–36 Gy)
In advanced stages:
– Younger patients: HD-AraC containing regimens plus rituximab
followed by ASCT and rituximab maintenance
– Elderly patients: conventional immunochemotherapy (e.g. R-CHOP,
VR-CAP, BR, R-BAC) followed by rituximab maintenance.
In relapse:
– Targeted approaches (ibrutinib, lenalidomide) should be considered,
temsirolimus and bortezomib should be preferably combined with ChT
– In younger patients, an alloSCT should be discussed
– Consider participation in trials
alloSCT, allogeneic stem cell transplantation; ASCT, autologous stem
cell transplantation; BR, bendamustine and rituximab; ChT, chemotherapy; HD-AraC, high dose cytarabine; MIPI-c, combined mantle cell
lymphoma international prognostic index; R-BAC, rituximab, bendamustine and cytarabine; R-CHOP, rituximab plus cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone; VR-CAP, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone with bortezomib; RT,
radiotherapy.

Clinical Practice Guidelines
The selection of the optimal treatment of any given patient is
based mainly on clinical and biological risk factors, symptoms
and tumour load (Figure 2). PET and MRD-based tailored treatments are currently being evaluated in studies but are not yet part
of routine clinical practice.
New agents, especially other inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) or cyclindependent kinases (CDK), are currently being investigated [53].

Follow-up, long-term implications and
survivorship
The following recommendations are based on consensus rather
than on evidence (see Table 7):

Table 9. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation (adapted from
the Infectious Diseases Society of America-United States Public Health
Service Grading Systema)
Levels of evidence
I
Evidence from at least one large randomised, controlled trial of
good methodological quality (low potential for bias) or metaanalyses of well-conducted randomised trials without
heterogeneity
II
Small randomised trials or large randomised trials with a suspicion
of bias (lower methodological quality) or meta-analyses of such
trials or of trials with demonstrated heterogeneity
III
Prospective cohort studies
IV
Retrospective cohort studies or case–control studies
V
Studies without control group, case reports, experts opinions
Grades of recommendation
A
Strong evidence for efﬁcacy with a substantial clinical beneﬁt,
strongly recommended
B
Strong or moderate evidence for efﬁcacy but with a limited clinical beneﬁt, generally recommended
C
Insufﬁcient evidence for efﬁcacy or beneﬁt does not outweigh
the risk or the disadvantages (adverse events, costs, . . .),
optional
D
Moderate evidence against efﬁcacy or for adverse outcome, generally not recommended
E
Strong evidence against efﬁcacy or for adverse outcome, never
recommended

History and physical examination, blood counts and routine
chemistry every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3
additional years and, subsequently, once a year [V, D].
Annual evaluation of thyroid function in patients after irradiation of the neck.
Optional CT scan (or ultrasound examinations to reduce radiation exposure) every 3–6 months for 2 years and every 6–
12 months up to 5 years. However, there is no strong evidence
to support a regular radiological follow-up. These recommendations are driven by the concern to minimise radiation exposure and lack of evidence for survival advantage conferred
with routine surveillance imaging. PET-CT should not be
used for surveillance.
Some studies suggest that pre-emptive treatment may be efﬁcient. However, MRD screening may be carried out but
should not guide therapeutic strategies outside clinical
studies.

Methodology
These Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in accordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical
Practice Guidelines development http://www.esmo.org/
Guidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology. The relevant literature has been selected by the expert authors. A summary of
recommended treatment strategies outside of clinical studies is
provided in Figure 2, and a summary of recommendations is
provided in Table 8. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation have been applied using the system shown in
Table 9. Statements without grading were considered justified
standard clinical practice by the experts and the ESMO Faculty.
This manuscript has been subjected to an anonymous peer review process.
