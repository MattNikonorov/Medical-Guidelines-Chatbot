T

hese Guidelines were developed by the European
Hematology Association (EHA) and European Society
for Medical Oncology (ESMO). The 2 societies nominated authors to write the guidelines as well as reviewers
to comment on them. These guidelines were approved by the EHA
Board and the ESMO Guidelines Committee in November 2020.

Incidence and epidemiology
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm that
accounts for 1%-1.8% of all cancers and is the second most
common haematological malignancy with an estimated incidence in Europe of 4.5-6.0/100 000/y. Despite the significant
improvement in patients’ survival over the past 20 years, only
10%-15% of patients achieve or exceed expected survival compared with the matched general population.1

Highlights
• This EHA-ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline provides key
recommendations on the management of multiple myeloma
• Authorship includes a multidisciplinary group of experts
from different institutions and countries in Europe
• Key treatment recommendations are provided for both newly
diagnosed myeloma patients and patients with relapsed/
refractory disease
• Recommendations for the treatment of plasma cell leukaemia, solitary plasmacytoma and smouldering myeloma are
also provided
• Key recommendations for myeloma complications, including
bone disease and renal impairment, are included

Diagnosis and staging
In 2017, ESMO published clinical practice guidelines for the
diagnosis, staging and definitions of progressive disease, relapse
and refractoriness to therapy, which have not changed and are
summarised in Supplementary Tables S1-S3, http://links.lww.
com/HS/A128.2
The recommendations for the tests that are required for the
diagnosis, determination of prognosis and follow-up of MM are
described in Table 1.

Sustained MRD negativity is supported by IMWG guidelines,4 although it is not fully reimbursed in several countries. In a recent “Real-World” study, MRD assessments were carried out in 139 patients
before starting lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT and/or at the achievement of CR, while additional assessments were subsequently carried out on an annual basis until sustained MRD negativity was
confirmed. In total, 34.3% of patients who were MRD-positive after induction treatment achieved MRD-negative status during maintenance and ultimately had improved PFS. Sequential MRD assessments
identified patients with progressively decreasing MRD levels who also had better PFS outcomes, compared with patients not showing a decreasing pattern of MRD.5

Response criteria to anti-myeloma therapy

MRD has been found to be a surrogate endpoint for PFS in
patients receiving first-line treatment.9 Therefore, MRD may
be used as an endpoint to accelerate drug development. The
use of MRD to drive treatment decisions is under investigation, for example, whether maintenance/continuous therapy
in MRD-negative patients can be stopped or whether treatment needs to be changed in MRD-positive patients, especially in high-risk MM. The results of several phase III trials
in the field will clarify the role of MRD in making decisions
about therapy in MM.

One of the most significant improvements in the response
criteria is the introduction of minimal residual disease (MRD)
both in the bone marrow (BM) (using either next-generation
sequencing or next-generation flow [NGF] cytometry) and outside the BM (using positron emission tomography-computed
tomography [PET-CT]; imaging MRD).4 MRD negativity in
the BM in patients who have achieved conventional complete
response (CR) consistently correlates with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in both
newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) and relapsed/refractory MM
(RRMM) patients.6,7
MRD negativity in the BM, defined as the absence of
tumour plasma cells within 1 000 000 BM cells (<10–6)
shows the best results for the prediction of both PFS and OS
compared with higher cutoff values (ie, 10–5).6 Outside the
BM, PET-CT is able to recognise hypermetabolic areas in
approximately 15%-20% of patients with MRD negativity
in the BM and is considered the best method for imaging
MRD to date. 8

Front-line therapy
Smouldering MM
Patients with standard- or intermediate-risk smouldering
MM (SMM; see Supplementary Table S4, http://links.lww.com/
HS/A128) do not need immediate therapy. Myeloma treatment
should be initiated according to the International Myeloma
Working Group (IMWG) recommendations.10 Regarding

thalidomide, dexamethasone (VTD) induction showed better response rates over VCD at the expense of a higher rate
of peripheral neuropathy.20 VCD and bortezomib, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (PAd) were equally effective in terms
of response but VCD was less toxic.21 In single-arm studies,
VRd produced high very good partial response (VGPR), CR
and MRD negativity rates, as well as prolonged PFS.6,17,22-24
However, there is no direct comparison between VTD with VRd
induction before ASCT. There is only an integrated analysis of
3 randomised trials, presented in abstract form, which showed
that VRd produces higher VGPR and MRD negativity rates
compared with VTD.25
The introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and
especially of Dara, in the front-line setting has changed the
treatment landscape in MM. In the phase III CASSIOPEIA trial,
4 cycles of induction with VTD (n = 542) were compared with
4 cycles of VTD plus Dara (DaraVTD) (n = 543); patients then
received a single ASCT followed by consolidation and maintenance.26 PFS at 18 months showed the superiority of DaraVTD
over VTD (93% versus 85%, P < 0.0001).27 The combination of
Dara with VRd (DaraVRd) had better results. In the randomised
phase II GRIFFIN study, 207 patients were randomly assigned
to receive VRd ± Dara induction (4 cycles), ASCT, VRd ± Dara
consolidation (2 cycles) and lenalidomide ± Dara maintenance
(26 cycles). The 24-month PFS rates were 95.8% for DaraVRd
and 89.8% for VRd.23
The substitution of bortezomib with the second-generation proteasome inhibitor (PI) carfilzomib (K) resulted in high
sustained MRD negativity rate in carfilzomib, lenalidomide
and dexamethasone (KRd) compared with VRd, especially in
patients with advanced R-ISS.28 There is no direct comparison
between VRd and KRd in NDMM patients who are eligible for
ASCT; however, in the ENDURANCE trial (see Elderly patients’
section), which included <30% of patients who received an
ASCT, there was no PFS difference between the 2 regimens.
Based on the above data, VRd is likely to offer the best
risk-benefit profile to date among triplet combinations (II, B).
The 4-drug combination DaraVTD is more efficacious than
VTD (I, A) but comparisons are lacking versus DaraVRd or
VRd (these regimens have not been approved by the European
Medicines Agency [EMA]). The EMA approval of DaraVTD
makes it a new standard of care for induction before ASCT.
Novel studies that are ongoing compare DaraVRd versus VRd,
DaraVCD versus VTD, or combinations with novel mAbs such
as IsaVRd, IsaKRd or EloVRd will reveal the best induction regimen in the future.

high-risk SMM, which is recently defined by the “20-20-20”
rule (Supplementary Table S4, http://links.lww.com/HS/A128),11
2 randomised, phase III studies have shown that lenalidomide
plays a significant role in prolonging PFS. In the first study, 119
patients with high-risk SMM (before the introduction of the new
criteria for the definition of myeloma10) were randomly assigned
either to receive treatment with the combination of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd) for 9 cycles followed by lenalidomide maintenance or to observation. At a median follow-up
of 75 months, Rd improved both PFS (median PFS [mPFS]
not reached versus 23 mo; P < 0.0001) and OS compared with
observation (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43; P = 0.024).12,13 However,
this study was conducted several years ago and enrolled a number of patients who are considered as having MM according to
the revised definition. In the second study,14 182 patients with
intermediate- or high-risk SMM were randomly assigned either
to receive lenalidomide monotherapy or to observation. At a
median follow-up of 35 months, PFS was longer with lenalidomide (HR = 0.28; P = 0.002); this result was driven mainly by the
high-risk SMM group.14 This study has not reported OS advantage for the lenalidomide arm to date. Several phase II studies
using daratumumab (Dara) monotherapy,15 isatuximab (Isa)
monotherapy or other Rd-based regimens (with elotuzumab
[EloRd], or with ixazomib) have shown encouraging results.
All the above data suggest that high-risk SMM patients
should be encouraged to participate in randomised phase III
trials to reveal the best treatment that offers OS advantage. To
date, no treatment has been approved for SMM.

Newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for
high-dose therapy and autologous transplantation
For fit NDMM patients, aged <70 years, without comorbidities, induction followed by high-dose therapy (HDT) with
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and lenalidomide
maintenance is the recommended treatment. Two recent phase
III trials comparing the use or not of upfront ASCT, after triplet
novel agent-based induction, showed that PFS was improved in
the upfront ASCT arm.16-18 The first study was conducted by the
French Myeloma Study Group and included 700 patients who
were randomised to receive induction therapy with 3 cycles of
bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) and then
consolidation therapy with either 5 additional cycles of VRd or
high-dose melphalan (HDM) plus ASCT followed by 2 additional cycles of VRd. Patients in both groups received maintenance therapy with lenalidomide for 1 year. After a median
follow-up of 44 months in the VRd-alone group and 43 months
in the ASCT group, the mPFS was longer in the ASCT group
(50 versus 36 mo; P < 0.001). This benefit was observed across
all patient subgroups, including advanced Revised International
Staging System (R-ISS) and high-risk cytogenetics. OS at 4 years
was not different between the ASCT and the non-ASCT groups.17
The second study was conducted by the European Myeloma
Network (EMN)—EMN02/HO95 trial—and included 1503
patients who received an induction therapy with 3-4 cycles
of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (VCD)
followed by the first randomisation between bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP) versus ASCT. A second randomisation to consolidation therapy (2 cycles of VRd) versus no
consolidation was carried out after intensification therapy, to
be followed by lenalidomide maintenance until progression or
toxicity in both arms. With a median follow-up from the first
randomisation of 60.3 months, the mPFS was improved with
ASCT compared with VMP (56.7 versus 41.9 mo; P = 0.0001).18

Conditioning regimen before ASCT

HDM (200 mg/m2) remains the standard conditioning regimen before ASCT for NDMM patients. The addition of busulfan to melphalan has not shown OS benefit over HDM.29,30 The
addition of bortezomib to HDM did not improve the efficacy of
the conditioning regimen and had higher toxicity.31

Consolidation therapy

The EMN02/HO95 study showed that at a median follow-up of 42 months, consolidation therapy with 2 cycles of
VRd improved mPFS compared with no consolidation (58.9
versus 45.5 mo; P = 0.014).18 It must be noted that induction
treatment in this study included 4 cycles of VCD and not VRd
or DaraVTD.
The use of a second planned ASCT as consolidation has also
been tested in clinical trials. In the EMN02/HO95 study, in
centres with a policy of double ASCT, patients were assigned
to receive VMP, single ASCT (ASCT-1) or 2 planned ASCTs
(administered 2-3 mo apart; ASCT-2) to prospectively compare
ASCT-1 with ASCT-2. Patients who received ASCT-2 had a
prolonged PFS compared with those who received ASCT-1: the
3-year PFS probability was 53.5% for ASCT-2 versus 44.9% for

ASCT-1 group (P = 0.036), which represented a 26% reduced
risk of progression or death in the ASCT-2 group. Importantly,
ASCT-2 significantly improved the outcome of patients with
high-risk cytogenetics (mPFS: 46 and 26.7 mo for ASCT-2 and
ASCT-1, respectively; HR = 0.59; P = 0.062).16 In the same study,
OS from the first randomisation was significantly prolonged
with ASCT-2 compared with ASCT-1 (3-y rate: 89% versus
82%; HR = 0.52; P = 0.011); this benefit was also reported in
patients with R-ISS II + III (HR = 0.48; P = 0.013) and with highrisk cytogenetics (HR = 0.52; P = 0.042).16
The phase III StaMINA study randomised 758 patients who
received induction therapy for up to 12 cycles, followed by 1
ASCT versus tandem ASCT versus ASCT-1 followed by 4 subsequent cycles of VRd; all treatment groups received lenalidomide
maintenance until disease progression.32 The 6-year PFS in highrisk patients was 43.6% and 26% for tandem ASCT and ASCT-1,
respectively (P = 0.03).33
Finally, a study which compared tandem ASCTs with ASCT-1
followed by allogeneic SCT (allo-SCT) has recently reported
the 10-year median follow-up results. In both standard-risk
(n = 625) and high-risk patients (n = 85), there was no PFS or OS
difference.34

Before 2019, VMP and Rd were the standards of care
for NDMM patients who were not eligible for an ASCT in
Europe.41,42 A phase III trial comparing VRd with Rd in 525
NDMM patients (43% were younger than 65 y old) was
recently updated and showed the superiority of VRd regarding PFS (mPFS: 41 versus 29 mo; P = 0.003) and OS (median
OS [mOS] not reached versus 69 mo; P = 0.0114).43 Based on
these results, the EMA approved VRd in April 2019 for use in
NDMM patients who are not eligible for ASCT. The substitution of bortezomib with K in the Rd combination seems not to
offer better results. The ENDURANCE trial, which compared
KRd versus VRd in NDMM patients without an immediate
intent for ASCT, failed to show superiority of KRd regarding
PFS in the study population (n = 1087), which included a low
number of patients with high-risk cytogenetics.44
The addition of Dara to VMP and Rd has created 2 new
standards of care. DaraVMP and DaraRd were approved by
the EMA in October 2019, based on the results of 2 large phase
III studies. In the ALCYONE study, 706 patients with NDMM
who were ineligible for ASCT were randomised to receive 9
cycles of VMP either alone or with Dara (DaraVMP); then Dara
was given until disease progression.45 At a median follow-up
of 40 months, the mPFS was 36.4 versus 19.3 months for the
DaraVMP and VMP arms, respectively, while the 36-month
rate of OS was 78% and 68% for the 2 groups (HR = 0.60;
P = 0.0003).46 In the MAIA study, 737 NDMM patients who
were ineligible for ASCT were randomised to receive either
DaraRd or Rd until disease progression. At a median follow-up
of 28 months, the estimated PFS at 30 months was 70.6% in
the DaraRd group and 55.6% in the Rd group (HR = 0.56;
P < 0.001).47
Other approved regimens in this setting include bendamustine plus prednisone48 and melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide (MPR),49 but they are not routinely used and cannot be
considered as standards of care.
It is important to realise that one-third of patients are older
than 75 years at diagnosis and at least 30% are frail. Please refer
to Management of frail elderly patients in the Supplementary
Material, http://links.lww.com/HS/A128, for consensus panel
recommendations for the management of these patients.
Although maintenance is not standard for patients who are
not eligible for ASCT (almost all approved regimens are used
continuously until progression or unacceptable toxicity), ixazomib maintenance was tested in a phase III study which included
706 patients who received 6-12 months of standard induction
before being randomised to receive either ixazomib or placebo.
Ixazomib maintenance offered a PFS benefit over placebo (17.4
versus 9.4 months, HR = 0.65, P = 0.00003).50 Figure 1 depicts
the first-line options for the treatment of NDMM patients.

Maintenance therapy

Treatment with lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT
offers PFS and OS benefits over placebo as reported in 2
large randomised trials.35,36 A meta-analysis including
more than 1200 patients, with a median follow-up of 79.5
months, showed that lenalidomide maintenance offers more
than 2 years of PFS benefit (52.8 versus 23.5 mo) and 2.5
years of OS benefit over placebo. In this study, there was
no benefit in patients with ISS-III disease or high-risk cytogenetics.37 However, the Medical Research Council (MRC)
myeloma-XI trial, in which 1137 patients were assigned to
lenalidomide maintenance and 834 patients to observation,
showed that, in high-risk patients, the 3-year OS was 75%
in the lenalidomide group compared with 64% in the observation group, and in ultra-high-risk patients it was 63% versus 43.5%, respectively.38 These results should be taken with
caution as the study was not powered to show differences
in the 2 sub-populations and all patients who entered the
maintenance phase were immunomodulatory drug (IMiD)exposed and -sensitive. Furthermore the definition of highrisk patients was different in the meta-analysis and in the
MRC-XI trial; in the meta-analysis, high-risk cytogenetics included only t(4;14) and del17p patients while in the
MRC-XI trial patients were classified into 3 cytogenetic risk
groups: standard risk (no adverse cytogenetic abnormalities),
high risk (1 adverse cytogenetic abnormality), or ultra-high
risk (2 or more adverse cytogenetic abnormalities) [adverse
cytogenetic abnormalities were defined as gain(1q), t(4;14),
t(14;16), t(14;20), or del(17p)].37,38 The EMA has approved
lenalidomide for maintenance therapy post-ASCT for all
MM patients until progression.
Bortezomib maintenance showed PFS benefit compared with
thalidomide maintenance in a randomised study, but the induction treatment was not the same between the 2 treatment groups
(PAd versus vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone [VAD],
respectively).39 A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase
III trial (TOURMALINE-MM3) compared the oral PI ixazomib
with placebo in 656 patients who received induction therapy
plus HDM + ASCT. There was a 28% reduction in the risk of
progression or death with ixazomib (mPFS: 26.5 versus 21.3
mo, respectively; P = 0.0023). In the high-risk population, ixazomib also offered similar PFS advantage over placebo (HR = 0.62,
95% confidence interval = 0.38-1.02).40 Bortezomib and ixazomib have not yet been approved by the EMA for maintenance
after ASCT.

Recommendations
• “Watch-and-wait” remains the recommended approach for
SMM (II, B). High-risk patients are encouraged to participate in randomised phase III studies that are powered for OS
advantage of the experimental treatment modality.
• For patients <70 years without comorbidities, induction therapy followed by HDM and ASCT is the recommended treatment (I, A).
• Regarding induction therapy pre-ASCT, VRd is likely to offer
the best risk-benefit profile to date among triplets based on
bortezomib (II, B); however, VRd lacks direct comparisons
with VTD or DaraVTD and is not licensed by the EMA. The

Ixazomib maintenance offers PFS benefit over placebo (I, A),
but has not been approved by the EMA or the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA).
• For patients who are not eligible for ASCT, there are 3 new
standards of care: VRd, DaraVMP and DaraRd (I, A). When
DaraRd and DaraVMP are not available, VRd is the preferred
option in fit patients; Rd and VMP may be considered for
patients who cannot receive the previous regimens (I, A).

4-drug combination DaraVTD is more efficacious than VTD
(I, A) and is the new standard of care. If this is not available,
VTD (I, A) or VCD (II, B) may be used. DaraVRd and IsaVRd are under clinical investigation and may be standards
of care in the near future. Induction with 4-6 cycles is the
recommended approach.
• HDM (200 mg/m2) is the standard conditioning regimen
before ASCT (I, A).
• Consolidation therapy post-ASCT has not been established to
date as standard therapy; 2 cycles of VRd consolidation has
to be considered in patients who receive VCD induction (II,
B), while a tandem ASCT is recommended for patients with
genetically defined high-risk disease (II, B) or in all patients
who received VCD induction (II, B). Allo-SCT following
ASCT does not offer OS benefit even in high-risk disease compared with tandem ASCT.
• Maintenance with lenalidomide is considered the standard
of care for all MM patients post-ASCT (I, A); bortezomib
may be considered for patients with high-risk disease (II, B).

Treatment of relapsed/refractory patients
Patients who have received 1 prior line of therapy
Salvage ASCT may be an option for patients who have
received front-line induction with bortezomib-based triplet
combination followed by an ASCT. Two prospective studies of
salvage ASCT have been published so far. The first included a
bortezomib-based re-induction and a randomisation between

(17.8 versus 9.5 mo; P = 0.03).64 PomVd was approved by the
EMA in May 2019.
In the second study (CANDOR), DaraKd was compared
with Kd in RRMM patients who had received 1 prior line of
therapy. This study showed that the mPFS was not reached for
the DaraKd group and it was 15.8 months for the Kd group
(HR = 0.63; P = 0.0014). DaraKd resulted in a better PFS benefit
both among lenalidomide-exposed (HR = 0.52) and lenalidomide-refractory patients (HR = 0.45).65
Finally, in the third study, which was reported at the EHA
2020 meeting, only 302 patients with RRMM and 1-3 prior
lines of therapy were randomised to receive either IsaKd
(n = 179) or Kd (n = 123). At a median follow-up of 20.7 months,
mPFS was not reached for IsaKd whereas it was 19.1 months
for Kd (HR = 0.53; P = 0.0007).66
Thus, PomVd, DaraKd and IsaKd are recommended therapies for patients who were previously exposed or are refractory
to lenalidomide, while DaraKd or IsaKd can also be given in
patients who are refractory to bortezomib.
The approval of Dara-based regimens (DaraVTD, DaraVMP
and DaraRd) and of VRd, as first-line therapy for myeloma
patients, makes the treatment of second and subsequent lines of
therapy very challenging. Although there is some evidence that
Dara retreatment can be efficacious in some patients,67,68 there
are no data for Dara retreatment at second line.
Venetoclax is a selective Bcl-2 inhibitor that promotes MM
cell apoptosis. The phase III BELLINI trial evaluated the combination of venetoclax with Vd (VenVd) compared with Vd among
RRMM patients, who had received 1-3 prior lines of therapy
and were PI sensitive. A significant PFS benefit was reported with
VenVd among patients with t(11;14) (HR = 0.11; P = 0.004) and
those with high BCL2 gene expression (HR = 0.24; P<0.0001)
but no OS difference was shown in this population. On the contrary, Vd was superior to VenVd in terms of OS among patients
without t(11;14) and low BCL2 gene expression (HR = 3.04;
P = 0.022).69 Therefore, VenVd is an option only for patients
with t(11;14) who have failed lenalidomide and are sensitive to
PI. Prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm the BELLINI
findings in patients with RRMM with high BCL2 gene expression. Furthermore, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for
all patients receiving VenVd. Venetoclax is not currently licensed
for treatment of MM.
Selinexor is an oral, selective inhibitor of exportin 1 protein-mediated nuclear export, leading to the reactivation of
tumour-suppressor proteins. Selinexor in combination with
Vd (SVd) was compared with Vd in a phase III study with 402
patients with RRMM who received 1-3 prior lines of therapy.
SVd significantly prolonged mPFS compared with Vd (13.9 versus 9.4 mo, HR = 0.70, P = 0.0066), suggesting that SVd might
be another option in patients who were treated with lenalidomide-based regimens upfront.70 SVd is awaiting EMA approval.
In Figure 2, the possible options for second-line therapy, taking into consideration the previous line and the refractoriness to
specific agents, are described. For Dara-previously exposed or
-refractory patients, the recommendations are based on panel
opinion as there is no evidence for the efficacy of the approved
second-line regimens in these patients to date.

salvage ASCT or cyclophosphamide, which is suboptimal
for relapsed patients. Salvage ASCT significantly extended
mPFS (19 versus 11 mo; P < 0.001) and OS (67 versus 52 mo;
P = 0.0169).51 The second included patients with first to third
relapse who were randomised to a transplant arm (n = 139)
consisting of 3 Rd re-induction cycles, ASCT and lenalidomide
maintenance (10 mg/d) or to a control arm (n = 138) of continuous Rd. Although there was no difference regarding PFS
and OS between the 2 arms, almost 30% of the patients in
the transplant arm did not receive the assigned ASCT mainly
due to early disease progression. Multivariate landmark
analyses from the time of ASCT showed superior PFS and
OS (P = 0.0087 and P = 0.0057, respectively) in patients who
received ASCT.52 The American and European Associations for
Bone and Marrow Transplantation have reported that HDT
and ASCT should be considered appropriate treatment of any
patient relapsing after primary therapy that includes an ASCT
with initial remission duration of >18 months.53 However, this
recommendation was made before the broad use of lenalidomide as maintenance therapy post-ASCT. Although there is no
evidence for the role of salvage ASCT in patients who received
lenalidomide maintenance, the panel suggests that second-line
ASCT is a logical approach for patients who relapse after primary therapy that includes an ASCT followed by lenalidomide
maintenance and had an initial remission duration of ≥36
months. The use of re-induction is a matter of debate as there
is no prospective study on this issue. Retrospective studies suggest that the use of re-induction does not offer survival benefit
in salvage ASCT.54
In patients in whom a salvage ASCT is not considered, the
second-line therapy should include an Rd-based regimen,
that is, KRd, DaraRd, ixazomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone
(IRd) or EloRd for patients who received a bortezomib-based
therapy upfront without lenalidomide or Dara (ie, VCD, VTD,
VMP); all these combinations were found to be superior to
Rd, in terms of PFS, in pivotal phase III studies.55-58 Based on
both HR and absolute values of mPFS, DaraRd provides the
longest PFS for patients with RRMM who have received 1-3
prior lines of therapy and have a standard-risk cytogenetic
profile. KRd and EloRd have also shown OS benefit over Rd:
mOS 48.3 versus 40.4 months for KRd versus Rd (HR = 0.79;
P = 0.0045),59 and 48.3 versus 39.6 months for EloRd versus
Rd,60 respectively. DaraRd is likely to have OS benefit over
Rd, but mature data have not been presented, while IRd has
no OS benefit over Rd. For relapsed patients with high-risk
cytogenetics, although different cutoff values are used for the
definition of del17p positivity, all above triplets have shown
better results compared with Rd; however, the combination of
a PI with Rd, that is, KRd or IRd, along with DaraRd seem to
offer the best benefit to date.
Elderly patients who received Rd upfront without Dara61 or
patients who received lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT
and are progressing (lenalidomide-refractory patients), according to previous guidelines, could receive either K plus dexamethasone (Kd) or Dara and bortezomib plus dexamethasone
(DaraVd) (patients treated with Kd or DaraVd had significantly
improved PFS compared with Vd).62,63 Three phase III studies
suggest that the combination of pomalidomide with bortezomib and dexamethasone (PomVd) and the combinations of
Dara or Isa with K and dexamethasone (DaraKd or IsaKd)
are new options for this setting.62-64 In the first study, PomVd
(n = 278) was compared with Vd (n = 270) in RRMM patients
who had received 1-3 prior lines of therapy that included lenalidomide. More than 70% of the patients were refractory to
lenalidomide. After a median follow-up of 16 months, PomVd
improved mPFS in the study population (11.2 versus 7.1 mo;
HR = 0.61; P < 0.0001) as well as in patients refractory to lenalidomide (9.5 versus 5.6 mo; P = 0.0008) and in patients refractory to lenalidomide who received only 1 prior line of treatment

Patients who have received 2 or more prior lines of
therapy
Treatment of RRMM patients who received 2 or more prior
lines of therapy is becoming challenging.71 A recent study
revealed that patients who are refractory to 2 PIs, 2 IMiDs and
a CD38 mAb have an mOS of 5.6 months only.72 For patients
who have been exposed or are refractory to both bortezomib
and lenalidomide, who have not received an mAb, DaraKd or
IsaKd are suitable options. The combinations of Elo or Isa with

Figure 3. Recommendations for MM patients who received a third or subsequent line of therapy. aOnly phase IB data are published for DaraPd. Publication of phase III data are expected in 2021. bFor patients with t(11;14). Dara = daratumumab; Elo = elotuzumab; IMiD =

pomalidomide and dexamethasone (EloPd and IsaPd, respectively) are suitable options for patients who have failed ≥2 lines
of previous therapies, including lenalidomide and a PI, based on
the results of 2 studies. The first was a phase II study, in which
patients were randomly assigned to receive either EloPd (n = 60)
or Pd (n = 57). After a follow-up period of 9 months, the mPFS
was 10.3 months in the EloPd group and 4.7 in the Pd group
(HR = 0.54; P = 0.008).73 The second was a phase III study, in
which patients were randomised to receive either IsaPd (n = 154)
or Pd (n = 153). At a median follow-up of 11.6 months, mPFS
was 11.5 months in the IsaPd group versus 6.5 months in the Pd
group (HR = 0.596; P = 0.001).74 EloPd and IsaPd were recently
approved by the EMA in this setting.
The combination of Dara with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DaraPd) has been approved by the FDA for patients who
have failed ≥2 lines of previous therapies, including lenalidomide and a PI. This was based on a phase II nonrandomised
study where DaraPd was given in 103 patients with RRMM.
At a median follow-up of 13 months, the mPFS was 8.8 months
and the mOS was 17.5 months.75 DaraPd has not yet been
approved by the EMA, as the results of the phase III APOLLO
study (DaraPd versus Pd) are pending.
Patients with t(11;14), who are refractory to lenalidomide
and are PI-sensitive may be treated with VenVd, when this regimen is licensed, as previously discussed.
For triple-class refractory patients, selinexor-dexamethasone
(Sd) or belantamab mafodotin monotherapy may be suitable
options. In a phase II study with 122 RRMM patients (median
number of 7 prior lines of therapy), oral selinexor was given
with dexamethasone twice weekly. An mPFS of 3.7 months
and an mOS of 8.6 months were reported. Fatigue, nausea and
decreased appetite were common and were typically grade 1 or
2 events; grade 3 events were noted in up to 25% of patients
and no grade 4 events were reported.76

Belantamab mafodotin is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). In a phase II study,
196 patients with triple-class refractory MM received 2 different doses of belantamab mafodotin (2.5 and 3.4 mg/kg).
The mPFS was 2.9 and 4.9 months for the 2 doses, respectively. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events included
keratopathy (27% and 21% of patients for the 2 doses,
respectively), thrombocytopaenia and anaemia.77 Melflufen
may also be beneficial in Dara and pomalidomide-refractory
patients but the results of the phase III trial have not yet been
reported.78
Figure 3 summarises the recommendations for RRMM
patients who receive third or subsequent lines of therapy.
Immunotherapy strategies targeting BCMA or other antigens on the surface of myeloma cells, including bispecific T-cell
engagers (BiTEs) and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells,
are under clinical investigation in RRMM patients. Results for
the first published study with a CAR-T cell product in myeloma
patients showed that infusion of bb2121 in 33 consecutive
patients with multirefractory disease resulted in an objective
response rate of 85%, including 15 patients (45%) with CR;
all were MRD-negative. The mPFS was 11.8 months. CAR-T
cell expansion was associated with better responses and CAR-T
cells persisted up to 1 year after the infusion. A total of 25
patients (76%) had cytokine release syndrome, while neurological toxic effects occurred in 14 patients (42%).79 Several studies using other CAR-T cell products or T-cell engagers (TCEs)
were reported in the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) and EHA 2020 meetings and had similar results, suggesting that these immunotherapy techniques may increase survival of myeloma patients (see Supplementary Material, http://
links.lww.com/HS/A128, section on novel immunotherapies for
myeloma).

Recommendations

50 years of age with a suitable donor, a myeloablative allo-SCT
can be considered. Otherwise, a tandem transplant with an ASCT
followed by a reduced-intensity conditioning allo-SCT if a related
or an unrelated donor is available can be considered (IV, C).
Patients not eligible for transplant procedures should preferably receive continuous treatment (III, C). In relapsed/refractory
PPCL, a switch to drugs not used at diagnosis should be considered, favouring combinations of lenalidomide or pomalidomide
plus dexamethasone with K or mAbs (Dara or Elo) (expert consensus). See Supplementary Table S6, http://links.lww.com/HS/
A128, for summary recommendations.

Patients who receive second-line therapy

Downloaded from http://journals.lww.com/hemasphere by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCy
wCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 05/28/2023

• Second-line ASCT is an option for patients who received
primary therapy that included an ASCT followed by lenalidomide maintenance and had an initial remission duration of ≥36 months (panel consensus).
• Patients who had received a bortezomib-based therapy
upfront without lenalidomide or Dara should receive an
Rd-based regimen, that is, KRd, DaraRd, IRd or EloRd (I,
A). DaraRd provides the best PFS for these patients, while
only KRd and EloRd showed an OS benefit over Rd to date.
• Patients who are refractory to lenalidomide upfront could
receive either PomVD, DaraKd, IsaKd or DaraVd (I, A).
PomVd is the approved indication with best results, in terms
of PFS, as second-line therapy in lenalidomide-refractory
patients. DaraKd has given the best reported PFS to date in
lenalidomide-refractory patients, but DaraKd is awaiting EMA
approval. Similarly, IsaKd and SVd, which are also suitable for
this setting (I, A), have not yet been approved by the EMA.
• VenVd is a suitable option for patients with t(11;14) who
have failed lenalidomide and are sensitive to PIs (I, A), if
available.

Management of solitary plasmacytoma
Solitary plasmacytoma is an infrequent form of plasma cell
neoplasm that presents as a single mass of monoclonal plasma
cells, with either extramedullary or intraosseous location.3,86
Clonal PCs are typically absent in the BM aspirate by conventional morphology or immunohistochemistry and there are no
other MM features (hypercalcaemia, anaemia or renal disease
attributable to MM).10 In some patients, a BM aspiration can
detect a low monoclonal plasma cell infiltration, which indicates a high risk of early progression to an overt myeloma
disease.3,86 Furthermore, in a study following the use of high
sensitivity flow cytometry, half of the patients showed occult
BM infiltration and half of these cases progressed at 2 years.87
Thus, detection of clonal PC using sensitive techniques in the
BM is suggested (II, B) and systemic treatment of myeloma
should be considered in these patients (III, B). Before treatment
initiation, whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
PET-CT should be carried out to exclude the presence of multiple plasmacytomas, commending systemic treatment instead of
radiotherapy (RT) (I, A).8,88 Local high-dose RT is the preferred
treatment of choice (II, A), but about two-thirds of patients
develop MM at 10 years’ follow-up.89 With current staging techniques, that is, NGF and PET-CT, the incidence of solitary plasmacytoma is expected to decrease and the cure rate to increase.
See Supplementary Table S6, http://links.lww.com/HS/A128, for
summary recommendations.

Patients at third and subsequent lines of treatment
• For patients who have been exposed or are refractory to
both bortezomib and lenalidomide, DaraKd (I, A), IsaPd (I,
A), IsaKd (I, A) and EloPd (II, B) are recommended.
• Patients with t(11;14), who are refractory to lenalidomide and
are PI-sensitive may be treated with VenVd (I, A), if available.
• For triple-class refractory patients, Sd or belantamab
mafodotin monotherapy is recommended (II, B), if available. Results of phase III studies of melflufen, TCEs and
CAR-Ts in triple-class refractory patients are awaited.

Management of plasma cell leukaemia
Primary plasma cell leukaemia (PPCL) is a rare and aggressive
variant of MM, operationally defined by the presence of 20%
and/or an absolute number >2 × 109/L of clonal plasma cells in
the peripheral blood without a previous history of MM.80 The
cutoff value of circulating plasma cells for the definition of PCL
may be reduced to 5% in the near future, as the survival of these
patients is similar to those with 20% of circulating plasma cells.76
PPCL should be distinguished from secondary PCL, which generally constitutes the leukaemic evolution of a preexisting, end-stage
RRMM, and from extramedullary myeloma. Diagnostic work-up
and staging procedures in PPCL are similar to those applied in
MM. However, they have to be implemented by peripheral blood
analysis for measuring circulating PC count and PET-CT for
detecting possible extramedullary lesions.81
The outcome of patients with PCL remains poor and the mOS
is around 1 year.80,81 There are no precise guidelines for the treatment of PPCL due to the lack of phase III trials in this setting.
Only 2 prospective phase II studies have been published so far
for PPCL.82,83 Overall, treatment should be immediate and possibly oriented toward bortezomib and/or lenalidomide-based multiphase approaches in combination with chemotherapy agents,
with short treatment-free intervals. It should ideally include
induction, double ASCT, consolidation and maintenance (II, B).
KRd may be another option for these patients84 but more data are
needed before a recommendation can be made for PCL patients.
Allo-SCT should be considered in selected cases (III, C). In a
recent study, 71 patients (median age 56 y) with PPCL underwent
an allo-SCT and the 4-year outcomes were: nonrelapse mortality
12%, PFS 19% and OS 31%.85 Thus, in patients younger than

Supportive care
Recommendations for the management of myeloma complications, that is, bone disease, anaemia, BM failure, infections,
vaccination strategies and renal impairment, are described in the
Supplementary Material, http://links.lww.com/HS/A128, in the
section on Supportive Care.

Follow-up and long-term implications
Table 1 includes all tests that have to be carried out during
follow-up of myeloma patients. Full blood count, serum and
urine electrophoresis and serum-free light chain (sFLC) determination, creatinine and calcium tests should be carried out
monthly or at least every 3 months. sFLC should be used to
detect light chain escape. In cases of relapsed patients with no
positivity for del17p or add1q at diagnosis, fluorescence in situ
hybridization analysis for del17p and add1q should be carried
out to reveal high-risk relapse. In case of bone pain, wholebody low-dose CT (WBLD-CT), MRI or PET-CT should be
carried out to detect new bone lesions.3
MM has for a long time been considered as an incurable disease. Recent trials incorporating novel agents and ASCT report
a statistical cure fraction of more than 15%.1,24 The addition of
quadruplet combinations including mAbs as part of front-line
therapies and novel immunotherapy strategies seems to further
increase this apparent cure rate.

The presence of t(11;14) in RRMM patients should be investigated to decide for venetoclax-based regimens, when available
in Europe. Otherwise, no prognostic factor or staging system,
including R-ISS or gene-expression profiling, is used routinely
to define a risk-adapted strategy. In myeloma, more research
is needed to identify molecular markers which could lead to
advances in personalised medicine.

Methodology
These Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in accordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical
Practice Guidelines development (www.esmo.org/Guidelines/
ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology). An interdisciplinary panel of
clinical experts on MM, members of ESMO, EHA, and EMN
selected the relevant literature. Levels of evidence and grades
of recommendations were assigned according to the adapted
Infectious Diseases Society of America-United States Public
Health Service Grading System (Supplementary Table S7, http://
links.lww.com/HS/A128).90 Statements without grading were
considered justified standard clinical practice by the experts.
