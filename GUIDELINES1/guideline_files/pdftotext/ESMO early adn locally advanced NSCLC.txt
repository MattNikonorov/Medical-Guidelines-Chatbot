chemotherapy (ChT).3,4 A total of 682 patients were randomised (1 : 1) to receive 3 years of osimertinib 80 mg orally
once daily or placebo following recovery from surgery and
standard adjuvant ChT, if given. The major efﬁcacy outcome
measure was disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with stage
II-IIIA NSCLC determined by investigator assessment. With a
median follow-up for the primary endpoint of 22.1 months in
the osimertinib arm and 14.9 months in the placebo arm,
the median DFS was not reached [(38.8 months-not
evaluable (NE)] in patients on the osimertinib arm
compared with 19.6 months (16.6-24.5 months) on the placebo arm [hazard ratio (HR) 0.17, 99.1% conﬁdence interval
(CI) 0.11-0.26, P < 0.0001]. DFS in the overall study population was a secondary efﬁcacy outcome measure; the median
was not reached (NE-NE) in patients on the osimertinib arm
compared with 27.5 months (22.0-35.0 months) on the placebo arm (HR 0.20, 99.1% CI 0.14-0.30, P < 0.0001).3,4 The
DFS beneﬁt with osimertinib occurred in patients who
received adjuvant ChT (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.10-0.26), and
among those who did not (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.13-0.40),
knowing that ChT administration was not a stratiﬁcation
factor and this decision was left to the investigator.3
The recommended osimertinib dose for adjuvant treatment of early-stage NSCLC is 80 mg orally once daily, with or
without food, until disease recurrence, or unacceptable
toxicity, or for up to 3 years.

STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT
Locoregional staging

Neoadjuvant or adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors

The original Figure 1 is updated.

Unpublished data from phase III clinical trials have reported
that in patients with stage IB-IIIA NSCLC, neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus ChT increases the
rate of pathological complete response compared with ChT.
Likewise, in the same setting, adjuvant ICI with antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) leads to
increased DFS versus best supportive care (BSC) for patients
with PD-L1-positive tumours.
The recent phase III IMpower-010 trial assessed the role
of adjuvant atezolizumab 1200 mg every 3 weeks for
16 cycles versus BSC in completely resected stage IB-IIIA
NSCLC patients following recovery from surgery and standard adjuvant cisplatin-based ChT.5 In hierarchical testing,
atezolizumab signiﬁcantly improved the DFS versus BSC in
PD-L1-expressing tumour cells 1% (SP263 assay) stage
II-IIIA NSCLC [median DFS not reached versus 35.3 months,
(HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50-0.88, P ¼ 0.0039)], as well as in all
randomised stage II-IIIA tumours [median DFS 42.3 versus
35.3 months, (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.96, P ¼ 0.0205)].
Finally, in the intention-to-treat population, DFS did not
cross signiﬁcance boundary [HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.99,
P ¼ 0.04].5 Atezolizumab, however, does not have EMA
approval in this setting yet.
The primary analysis population from the three-arm
CheckMate 816 trial reported that nivolumab plus
platinum-based ChT for 3 cycles as neoadjuvant strategy in
patients with stage IB-IIIA NSCLC signiﬁcantly improved the

TREATMENT OF EARLY STAGES (STAGES I-IIIA)
The original section ‘Treatment of early stages (stages I-II)’ is
renamed ‘Treatment of early stages (stages I-IIIA)’. The
original recommendations are updated and a new
treatment algorithm provided (Figure 6). The ESMO-MCBS
table is updated to include osimertinib (Table 6).
Systemic therapy
Adjuvant treatment with targeted therapies
Adjuvant osimertinib for resected IB-IIIA NSCLC with
EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations.
Osimertinib is approved by both the United States Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines
Agency (EMA) as adjuvant therapy after complete tumour
resection in patients with stage IB-IIIA NSCLC whose
tumours have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations [I, A;
European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of
Clinical Beneﬁt Scale (ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 score: A].
Efﬁcacy was demonstrated in a randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial (ADAURA, NCT02511106) in patients
with centrally conﬁrmed EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21
L858R mutation-positive stage IB-IIIA NSCLC who had
complete tumour resection, with or without prior adjuvant

compared with ChT alone [24.0% versus 2.2%, odds ratio
13.94, 99% CI 3.49-55.75, P < 0.0001]. This beneﬁt was
consistent across disease stages, histologies, tumour
mutational burden and PD-L1 expression levels.6 There are
no data yet, however, on outcome with this strategy from
this phase III trial. Therefore, in stage IB-IIIA NSCLC, the
immune strategy in the (neo)adjuvant setting using ICIs 
CT is not yet standard. Several large phase III clinical trials
are still ongoing with immune strategy in the (neo)adjuvant
stage IB-IIIA clinical scenario.
Post-operative radiotherapy
The original recommendations are updated.
Recommendations
Adjuvant ChT
 Adjuvant ChT should be offered to patients with resected
TNM (tumourenodeemetastasis) 8th edition stage IIB
and III NSCLC [I, A] and can be considered in patients
with T2bN0, stage IIA resected primary tumour >4 cm
[II, B]. Pre-existing comorbidity, time from surgery and
post-operative recovery need to be taken into account
1638

in this decision taken in a multidisciplinary tumour board
[V, A].
For adjuvant ChT, a two-drug combination with cisplatin
is preferable [I, A]. In randomised studies, the attempted
cumulative cisplatin dose was up to 300 mg/m2, delivered in 3 to 4 cycles.
When cisplatin administration is not feasible, carboplatin
is an accepted alternative [IV, B].
Although the most frequently studied regimen is
cisplatin-vinorelbine, other combinations such as cisplatin
and gemcitabine, or docetaxel or pemetrexed (only in
adenocarcinoma tumours) could be also feasible [II, B].
Carboplatin and paclitaxel is a potential ChT option for
T2bN0, stage IIA resected primary tumour >4 cm [IV, B].

Adjuvant treatment with targeted therapies
 Osimertinib is indicated for the adjuvant treatment after
complete tumour resection in adult patients with stage
IB-IIIA NSCLC whose tumours have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations [I, A;
ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: A].
Post-operative radiotherapy
 Post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) in completely resected
early-stage I-IIIA NSCLC is not recommended [I, E].
 In case of microscopic residual tumour (R1) resection
(positive resection margin, chest wall), PORT should be
considered [IV, B].
 Even if such patients were not included in randomised,
clinical trials, adjuvant ChT should be considered in patients with R1 resection of stage IIA-IIB-III disease [V, A].
 In case both ChT and radiotherapy (RT) are administered
post-R1 surgery, RT may be administered before ChT [V, C].

TREATMENT OF LOCALLY ADVANCED STAGE (STAGE III)
The original recommendations are updated and a new
treatment algorithm provided (see Figure 6). The ESMOMCBS table is updated for durvalumab (see Table 6).
Resectable locally advanced NSCLC
PORT after resected stage III NSCLC. PORT should not be
used in patients with NSCLC following complete R0 resection and after (neo)adjuvant ChT, as no statistically signiﬁcant difference in 3-year DFS was shown in a randomised,
controlled trial.
The large randomised, controlled LungART trial presented at ESMO 2020 explored the role of modern mediastinal PORT in patients with completely resected NSCLC
with histo/cytologically proven N2 nodal involvement. The
study randomised 501 patients with completely resected
stage IIIA N2 NSCLC to PORT (54 Gy in 27-30 fractions or no
PORT). Safety analysis was carried out in 487 patients.7
LungART is the only large, adequately-powered, high-quality, randomised trial in the modern era to be completed in
these patients. The trial selected a well-deﬁned, high-risk

patient population (52% of patients had 2 N2 nodal stations involved), 91% of whom had undergone positron
emission tomography (PET) scans, and 95% of whom had
undergone systemic ChT. The quality of surgery carried out
was clearly speciﬁed and also reviewed centrally by a surgical committee.
At a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the DFS HR reported in
the trial was 0.85 (95% CI 0.67-1.07, P ¼ 0.16), with median
DFS times of 30.5 months for PORT and 22.8 months without
PORT. Three-year DFS rates were 47.1% and 43.8% with and
without PORT, respectively. There was also no evidence that
PORT improved overall survival (OS), with 3-year OS rates of
66.5% and 68.5% with and without PORT, respectively. Not
only did PORT fail to provide a survival beneﬁt, but it may
actually be harmful for patients, with an incidence of late
grade 3-4 cardiopulmonary toxicity twice that in patients
without PORT (10.8% versus 4.9%).
Consequently, PORT cannot be recommended for patients with completely resected stage I-III N2 NSCLC. Its
potential utility for locoregional disease control in resected
stage III N2 disease (decrease of the rate of mediastinal
relapse by 50%) is offset by the risk of over-added cardiopulmonary toxicity. Further analysis is needed to determine

whether certain patients, in particular, could beneﬁt. For
patients with incompletely resected R1 stage III NSCLC,
PORT should be considered, with thorough assessment in a
multidisciplinary tumour board.
Unresectable locally advanced NSCLC
The phase III PACIFIC trial randomised (2 : 1) 713 patients
with unresectable, locally-advanced NSCLC without disease
progression within the ﬁrst 42 days after concurrent chemoradiotherapy, to consolidative durvalumab for 1 year or
placebo.8 After a median follow-up of 34.2 months, the
median OS for durvalumab was reached (47.5 months
versus 29.1 months for placebo, HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.89),
and the estimated 5-year OS rates were 42.9% versus 33.4%
for durvalumab versus placebo, respectively. The median
PFS was 16.9 months for durvalumab and 5.6 months for
placebo (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45-0.68) with a 5-year PFS rate
of 33.1% versus 19.0%, respectively.8
A post hoc exploratory analysis of the mature survival
data requested by licensing European authorities observed
that the beneﬁt with durvalumab was not evident in patients with PD-L1 expression <1%. The signiﬁcance of this
observation is disputed.9

Recommendations
 NSCLC patients treated with radical intent should be
followed for treatment-related complications, detection of treatable relapse or occurrence of second primary lung cancer. Multidisciplinary team assessment is
required for feasibility check for treatment of locoregional relapse [III, A].
 Surveillance every 6 months for 2 years with a visit
including history, physical examination and contrastenhanced volume chest and abdominal CT scan at least
at 12 and 24 months is recommended, with optional
[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET if required, and
thereafter an annual visit including history, physical examination and chest/upper abdominal CT scan in order
to detect second primary tumours [III, B].

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) is an increasingly used method for the genomic
proﬁling of cancer. This approach has several advantages in
comparison with NGS of tissue biopsies: non-invasive, easily
accessible, and representative of the entire tumor burden
present within the patient.1 ctDNA assays may also detect
genetic aberrations arising from other sources, such as alterations of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate origin (CHIP).2
Here, we report three cases of patients who underwent
genomic proﬁling of cancer by NGS of ctDNA and for whom
the analysis of the results allowed the detection of an
additional occult malignancy.
From December 2020 to June 2021, 1086 patients underwent NGS of ctDNA by using the FoundationOne® Liquid
Assay3 at Gustave Roussy (Villejuif, France). Five (0.46%) of
them had a suspicion of a second cancer based on the
analysis of ctDNA sequencing. Three of them underwent
further investigations which conﬁrmed the presence of a
second malignancy and are presented below.
