Incidence and epidemiology
Non-epithelial ovarian tumours account for approximately 10%
of all ovarian cancers. Malignant germ cell tumours (GCTs)
occur mainly in young women whereas the most common type of
sex cord-stromal tumours (SCSTs), i.e. granulosa cell tumour,
occurs more often in middle age and in postmenopausal women
[1]. Malignant GCTs represent 5% of all ovarian cancers and
80% of the preadolescent malignant ovarian tumours. SCSTs are
rare neoplasms that account for approximately 3%–5% of
ovarian malignancies and the majority of ovarian tumours with
endocrine manifestations. The yearly-adjusted incidence rate is
3.7/1 000 000 and 2.1/1 000 000 women for GCTs and SCSTs,
respectively [1]. Small cell carcinoma of the ovary (SCCO) usually affects young women and children [2] with a very low incidence (less than 1% of ovarian cancers) [1]. Unlike GCTs, SCSTs
and steroid cell tumours are unilateral and occur over a wide
range of age; for instance, granulosa cell tumours and thecomas
are found mainly in peri- and postmenopausal women, whereas
juvenile granulosa cell tumours, Sertoli cell tumours and Sertoli–
Leydig cell tumours (SLCTs) usually develop in adolescents and
young females in whom maintenance of fertility is important [3].

Diagnosis and pathology/molecular biology
The initial symptoms and signs of non-epithelial ovarian cancers
are usually a subacute pelvic pain, feeling of pelvic pressure because
of a pelvic mass and menstrual irregularities. Diagnostic work-up
should include pelvic ultrasound, abdomino-pelvic computed
tomography (CT) scan, chest X-ray and positron emission tomography (PET) scan in selected cases (GCTs) [III, B]. In young

patients, serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), alphafoetoprotein (a-FP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, full
blood count and liver and renal function tests should be carried
out. Inhibin B is secreted by granulosa cell tumours and could be a
useful marker for the disease. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone
(AMH) may be a marker of ovarian reserve and granulosa cell
tumours in postmenopausal or post-oophorectomy women [4].
While these markers are nonspecific, they can provide prognostic
information, so quantitative hCG, a-FP, LDH and cancer antigen
125 (CA 125) should be measured preoperatively [5]. If gonadoblastoma is suspected, a preoperative karyotype should be
obtained on all premenarche girls because of the propensity of
these tumours to arise in dysgenetic gonads.
Most non-epithelial ovarian tumours arise from cells specific
to the ovary (germ cells, granulosa cells, theca cells, stromal fibroblasts and steroid cells); other less common gonadal tumours
arise from non-specific ovarian cells (mesenchymal cells). The
World Health Organization (WHO) classification of GCTs is presented in Table 1 [6, 7]. GCTs recapitulate steps of development,
from undifferentiated germ cells to adult tissues. Primitive GCTs
composed of undifferentiated germ cells and GCTs with extraembryonic differentiation are all malignant. Teratomas are the most
common GCTs; most are composed of mature tissues and are
benign (dermoid cysts). In immature teratomas, embryonic tissues indicate the malignant potential and grading is prognostically relevant [7]. Grade 1 tumours show rare foci of immature
neuroepithelial tissue that occupy < 1 low power field (40) in
any slide (low grade); grade 2 tumours show similar elements,
occupying 1–3 low power fields (40) in any slide (high grade);
grade 3 tumours exhibit large amounts of immature neuroepithelial tissue occupying > 3 low power fields (40) in any slide (high

grade). A two-tiered (low and high grades) system is now more
commonly used [8]. Other rare malignant GCTs constitute a heterogeneous group including somatic cancers arising in dermoids
and monodermal teratomas [7]. In the elderly, nondysgerminoma GCTs arise from epithelial ovarian cancer, usually
endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas. Primitive GCTs and
immature teratomas are chemosensitive and susceptible to
fertility-sparing surgery. Because of their chemosensitivity and
the increasing adoption of fertility-sparing surgery, correct
pathological diagnosis is essential and these cases should be
examined by gynaecological pathologists [V, B]. Diagnosis can be
made on conventional histological material; given the multiplicity of morphological features, immunohistochemical markers
(Table 2) and chromosome 12p fluorescent in situ hybridisation
(FISH) can be used to confirm the diagnosis in difficult cases.
SALL4 and OCT4 are widely used; more recently, it has been recognised that SOX2 is expressed in embryonal carcinoma and
primitive neuroectodermal tumours of teratomatous origin.
SCSTs and steroid cell tumours constitute a heterogeneous
group of tumours (Table 3) and vary in their capacity to produce
clinically significant amounts of steroid hormones. Granulosa
cell tumours are typically oestrogenic and may be associated with
various clinical syndromes, depending upon the age of the
patient. SLCTs typically produce androgens, and clinical virilisation is observed in 70%–85% of patients. Those with sex cord elements may be malignant, with granulosa cell tumours being the
most frequent histological type. Neoplasms of pure ovarian
stroma are mostly benign, with > 50% of them being fibromas.
In morphologically ambiguous cases, an immunopanel of inhibin
alpha, calretinin and FOXL2, together with FOXL2 (402C-G)
mutational analysis, is useful to confirm the diagnosis of adult
granulosa cell tumours (AGCTs) [V, B] [9]. Chang et al. demonstrated that another molecule involved in the tumourigenesis of

AGCTs is activin A [10]. A subset of SCSTs is typically negative
for FOXL2 on immunostaining (retiform or poorly differentiated
SLCT), but these tumours usually express inhibin alpha and/or
calretinin. Another recent finding has been the occurrence of
DICER1 mutations in SCST [V, C].
Small cell carcinomas of the ovary hypercalcaemic type
(SCCOHTs) are the most common form of ovarian undifferentiated carcinomas in women < 40 years old and the most common
ovarian tumour associated with hypercalcaemia (70%). This
tumour is typically unilateral and should be distinguished from
primitive GCTs and granulosa cell tumours (mainly juvenile).
Although its histogenesis is unknown, recent reports suggest that it
may represent an ovarian malignant rhabdoid tumour [11].
Recent studies have identified mutations in the SWItch/Sucrose
Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodelling gene,
SMARCA4 encoding BRG1. These mutations represent a frequent
event occurring in 76%–100% of SCCOHTs [12–14]. Germline
mutations in SMARCA4 or SMARCB1 were already known to predispose to the development of paediatric tumours, namely atypical
teratoid/rhabdoid tumours [15, 16]. SMARCA4 immunohistochemistry is highly sensitive and specific for a diagnosis of
SCCOHT [loss of SMARCA4 (BRG1) protein expression] and is
now useful in the differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated
ovarian tumours [17]. SCCOHTs usually react diffusely for WT1,
making the interpretation difficult. Differential diagnosis includes

juvenile or adult granulosa tumours, metastatic melanoma, dysgerminoma, Ewing tumour and undifferentiated carcinoma.

Staging and risk assessment
Prognostic factors
The staging system for non-epithelial ovarian cancers is generally
adopted from the one for epithelial ovarian cancer originally
defined by the International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics (FIGO) (Table 4) [18]. Outcomes appear to be superior when patients are treated in a large cancer centre, likely due
to the rare nature and infrequent presentation of these cancers
[19].
Outcomes may depend on the age at diagnosis. Premenarche
girls and women > 45 years who develop GCTs may have different tumour biology and a worse prognosis than postadolescent
females in the reproductive years. Patients with testicular cancer
are stratified as having good, intermediate or high risk for

recurrence based on clinical, pathological and serological
markers. Compared with testicular cancer, clinical prognosticators are less well defined for ovarian GCTs. Adverse factors
include age > 45 years, stage > I, incomplete surgical resection
and yolk sac tumour (YST) histology [20, 21].
Stage is also an important prognostic factor for SCSTs,
although advanced-stage diseases can also have a good prognosis
because of their sensitivity to chemotherapy (ChT). The FIGO
stage [18] and the intraperitoneal tumour rupture are the most
often reported prognostic factors. Patient age (> 50 years) and
the size of the tumour (> 5 cm) have a less certain prognostic
value [5]. The majority of these tumours can be cured, but
around 20% relapse or give rise to metastases that can be fatal
[III, A].
Prognosis of SCCOHT is poor with only 30%–40% long-term
survivors with standard treatment [2]. Potential favourable prognostic factors, in addition to disease stage (stage IA versus others)
are: age > 30 years; normal pre-operative calcium level; a tumour
size < 10 cm; the absence of large cells; and complete surgical
resection including bilateral oophorectomy [22, 23].

Clinical Practice Guidelines
Staging
A surgical approach can be carried out through open route or, in
selected cases, by minimally invasive approaches—laparoscopy
and robotics—to avoid tumour rupture during surgery. A careful
examination of the abdominal cavity is required. The staging procedure includes infracolic omentectomy, biopsy of the diaphragmatic peritoneum, paracolic gutters, pelvic peritoneum and
peritoneal washings in macroscopic stage I disease.
Germ cell tumours. There is no consensus about the role of systematic lymphadenectomy, but the omission of staging peritoneal procedures seems to increase the recurrence rate [24],
though without impact on overall survival [25]. GCTs, particularly dysgerminoma, have a high risk of nodal spread. On the
other hand, given the very high chemosensitivity of such
tumours, potential nodal metastasis should be cured by adjuvant
ChT in these patients [III, A].
Thus, nodal debulking surgery is only required in rare cases of
residual disease after ChT. In early-stage disease that does not
require adjuvant ChT because of favourable prognostic factors,
nodal dissection should be carried out only where there is evidence of nodal abnormalities during surgical exploration and/or
initial CT scan (lymphadenopathy) [III, A]. Patients not undergoing initial nodal staging surgery can be safely cured with ChT at
the time of the potential nodal recurrence [26].
Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with preservation of the
contralateral ovary and the uterus is now considered as the standard surgical treatment for young patients with GCTs [III, A].
This conservative management should be considered even in
the case of advanced disease because of the sensitivity of the
tumour to ChT [IV, B] [27]. Systematic ovarian biopsy is not necessary when the contralateral ovary is macroscopically normal [III,
A]. In case of macroscopic bilateral ovarian diseases (particularly
dysgerminoma or immature teratoma), preservation of at least a
healthy part of one ovary (unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and
contralateral cystectomy) and the uterus should be encouraged
[IV, B] [28]. In postmenopausal women and in patients with
advanced-stage disease or with bilateral ovarian involvement,
abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
could be carried out with careful surgical staging [III, A].
Sex cord-stromal tumours. The place of conservative treatment in
child-bearing age patients affected by SCSTs is somewhat different. Preservation of the uterus and contralateral ovary seems to
be safe in macroscopic stage IA disease but should not be carried
out in stages > I. Conservative surgery is also an acceptable
approach in young patients with stage I SCSTs [IV, B]. In the case
of juvenile granulosa cell tumours, the safety of this management
approach in stage IC disease remains controversial, particularly
in stage IC2 or IC3 disease [V, C]. In case of conservative treatment, an endometrial curettage (or hysterectomy in case of radical management) must be carried out to rule out concomitant
uterine cancers in patients with granulosa cell tumour [IV, B].
For SCSTs, retroperitoneal evaluation is not mandatory because
of the very low incidence of retroperitoneal metastases in earlystage disease [III, A]. Recent publications on incidence of lymph
node metastases in SCST support the position that lymphadenectomy is not needed in these patients [29]. SLCTs frequently have

Annals of Oncology
low-grade malignancy, although occasionally a retiform or
poorly differentiated (sarcomatoid) form may be malignant. In
postmenopausal women and in patients with advanced-stage disease or with bilateral ovarian involvement, abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be carried out
with careful surgical staging for SCST [III, A].
Small cell carcinomas of the ovary hypercalcaemic type. The prognosis of SCCOHT is very poor and the risk of extra-ovarian spread
high. All suspected cases should benefit from a review by an expert
pathologist and be discussed in a specialised tumour board [V, A].
Efforts should be made to treat patients in a more homogeneous
way through national and international networks [V, A].
Conventional surgical treatment includes radical surgery (bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy) combined with peritoneal and nodal staging surgery, even for macroscopically stage I disease [IV, A] [2]. The largest series to date reported a decline in
survival in patients treated conservatively [2]. As a result of the adjuvant treatment after surgery combining high-dose ChT (HDCT)
and radiotherapy (RT), the potential preservation of gonadal function is considered to be only conceptual even if one ovary and the
uterus are preserved [2]. Until now, no pregnancy has been reported
after this type of de-escalating surgical management [2].

Management of early stages
Germ cell tumours (Figures 1–3)
Most GCTs (60%–70%) are diagnosed at an early stage. Stage I
patients have an excellent prognosis with long-term disease-free status
of about 90%. Given the young age of patients, all efforts should be
made to preserve fertility. Fertility-sparing surgery appears to be safe
with excellent survival after long-term follow-up, yielding outcomes
equivalent to patients undergoing hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy [III, A]. Stage IA pure dysgerminoma should
be treated with surgery only [III, A] [24]. The recurrence rate in this
group of patients is relatively low (15%–25%) and they can be successfully treated at the time of relapse with a high likelihood of cure.
Patients with stage IA grade 1 immature teratoma do not require further adjuvant ChT after adequate surgical staging [III, A]. The need
for adjuvant ChT in stage IA G2–G3 and IB–IC is still controversial
[5]. Some published data (risk of relapse ranging from 2%–20% for
grade 2 to 20%–40% for grade 3 immature teratoma) indicate that all
grades of immature teratoma and all stage I dysgerminomas can be
managed with close surveillance after fertility-sparing surgery [III, B],
reserving ChT for those cases in which post-surgery recurrence is
documented [24, 30]. However, this policy is not universally accepted;
the benefit of not having ChT (i.e. the avoided risk weighed against
the risk of relapse and delayed treatment) needs to be discussed with
the patient. All patients with stage I YSTs are treated with adjuvant
ChT after surgery [31]. Recent data on paediatric patients suggest close
surveillance for stage I YSTs with complete surgical staging and negative postoperative a-FP, reserving ChT for patients who experience
recurrence [30], but this policy is not widely accepted [III, C].
Data from the literature show that the most used combination
is the 5-day bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin (BEP) regimen [III,
A] [31].

increase of the interval between clinical appointments [III, C] [32].
This is summarised in Table 5 [32]. Patient adherence to the
demanding visit schedule is of paramount importance. It is
extremely important to advise patients against pregnancy during the
first 2 years after initial diagnosis, as most relapses occur during this
time [1]. Whenever possible, patients undergoing active surveillance
protocols should be included in trials or prospective registries.

Sex cord-stromal tumours (Figures 4 and 5)
Most SCSTs (60%–95%) are diagnosed at an early stage. Stage IA
granulosa cell tumours have an excellent prognosis after surgery
alone and do not require adjuvant therapy [III, A].
The selection of early-stage SCST patients for any postoperative treatment is controversial. To date, the relative benefit of
adjuvant ChT has yet to be demonstrated. Some authors would
suggest adjuvant therapy for juvenile granulosa tumour stage IC
patients [IV, B]; in this case, platinum-based ChT is the treatment
of choice [III, A]. Also, more relapses were reported for patients
with AGCT stage IC2 compared with stage IC1 [33]; in this case,
adjuvant ChT can be discussed [IV, C].
The most commonly used regimen is the BEP combination [III,
A] [5]. Alternative ChT options include: paclitaxel and carboplatin

iv8 | Ray-Coquard et al.

[III, B] [34]; etoposide/cisplatin (EP); cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/cisplatin (CAP); or a platinum agent alone [III, A]. Due to the relative toxicity of BEP versus carboplatin/paclitaxel, particularly in
older age groups, and the limited evidence to support its use (some
non-randomised series suggest carboplatin/paclitaxel may be as effective as BEP), bleomycin should not be given to patients > 40 years
old or with pre-existing pulmonary disease [III, A].
For SLCTs, postoperative adjuvant ChT should be considered
for those patients with stage I poorly differentiated or with heterologous elements [IV, B].

Small cell carcinomas of the ovary hypercalcaemic
type
There is no international consensus regarding the optimal treatment of SCCOHT; a multimodal approach including ChT [III, B],
radical surgery [IV, A] and possibly RT [IV, C] is often proposed
(Figure 6). However, no randomised studies have been conducted
to date, and the available published data are composed of case
reports or small retrospective series with very heterogeneous management strategies [35].
SCCOHTs are particularly chemosensitive at the outset but
there is a risk for a rapid relapse. The choice of regimen is generally extrapolated from data in small cell lung carcinoma. A combination of a cisplatin and etoposide-based therapy is generally
considered most appropriate [III, B] [23, 36]. More recently,
HDCT for patients who achieved a complete response (CR; after
surgery and/or ChT) with autologous stem cell transplantation
(ASCT) rescue has been proposed and is associated with better
survival [II, C] [24, 36, 37].

Management of advanced disease
Germ cell tumours
Fertility-sparing surgery should also be considered in advanced
stages disease as cure rates remain high [IV, B]. The aim of surgery is
to remove as much gross tumour as possible; however, the procedure should be moderated to avoid delays in postoperative ChT and

Table 7. Summary of recommendations
Diagnosis and pathology/molecular biology
• Diagnostic work-up should include pelvic ultrasound, abdomino-pelvic CT scan and chest X-ray and PET scan in selected cases (GCTs) [III, B]
• In young adult patients, hCG, a-FP, LDH and inhibin B levels, full blood count and liver and renal function tests should be carried out
• In case of suspected gonadoblastomas, a preoperative karyotype should be obtained on all premenarche girls
• Histological second opinion by an expert pathologist should always be considered. Diagnosis can be made on conventional histological material [V, B]
• Neoplasms of pure ovarian stroma: in morphologically ambiguous cases, an immunopanel of inhibin alpha, calretinin and FOXL2, plus mutational analysis
for FOXL2 (402C-G), is useful to conﬁrm AGCTs [V, B]
Staging and risk assessment
• A surgical approach can be carried out through open route or, in selected cases, by laparoscopy and robotics approaches, thereby avoiding tumour rupture during surgery
• A careful examination of the abdominal cavity is required
• The staging procedure includes infracolic omentectomy, biopsy of the diaphragmatic peritoneum, paracolic gutters, pelvic peritoneum and peritoneal
washings (macroscopic stage I disease)
• Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with preservation of the contralateral ovary and the uterus is considered an adequate surgical treatment for patients
with GCTs. This should be considered even in advanced disease because of the sensitivity of the tumour to ChT [IV, B]. No systematic ovarian biopsy is
necessary when the contralateral ovary is macroscopically normal [III, A]
• Given the very high chemosensitivity of GCTs, potential nodal metastasis should be cured by adjuvant ChT in these patients [III, A]
• Nodal dissection should be carried out only if evidence of nodal abnormality [III, A]
• For SCSTs, retroperitoneal evaluation is not mandatory [III, A]
• An endometrial curettage must be carried out to rule out concomitant uterine cancers in patients with granulosa cell tumours [IV, B]
• Conservative surgery is also an acceptable approach in young patients with stage I SCSTs [IV, B]
• In postmenopausal women and in patients with advanced-stage disease or with bilateral ovarian involvement, abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy should be carried out with careful surgical staging for SCST [III, A]
Early-stage GCTs: management
• Stage IA pure dysgerminoma should be treated with surgery only [III, A]
• Patients with stage IA grade 1 immature teratoma do not require further adjuvant ChT after adequate surgical staging [III, A]
• Adjuvant ChT in stage IA-IC G2-G3 immature teratoma, stage IA-IB YST with negative postoperative tumour markers and IB-IC dysgerminomas is recommended but active surveillance is an option [III, B]
• 5-day BEP is the most used regimen [III, A]
• The close surveillance schedule involves regular clinical review with clinical examination, radiological imaging including abdomen-pelvic intravaginal
sonography at regular intervals and the monitoring of tumour markers to detect relapse over a period of 10 years, with a gradual increase of the interval
between clinical appointments [III, C]
Advanced-stage and recurrent GCTs: management
• Fertility-sparing surgery should be considered also in advanced stages [IV, B]. The aim of surgery is to remove as much gross tumour as possible; however,
the procedure should be moderated to avoid delays in postoperative ChT and long-term morbidity
• In postmenopausal women with advanced-stage disease or with bilateral ovarian involvement, abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy could be carried out with careful surgical staging [III, A]
• Platinum-based regimens are the treatment of choice with the BEP regimen being the most widely used, generally, three cycles of 5-day BEP regimen in
completely resected disease and four cycles (bleomycin should be omitted to reduce the risk of lung toxicity after the third cycle) for patients with macroscopic residual disease [III, A]
• In patients previously treated with platinum, with platinum-sensitive relapse (progression > 4–6 weeks after completion of ChT), combinations with
platinum should be considered [IV, C]
• Patients resistant to a cisplatin-based combination may receive VAC or paclitaxel/gemcitabine or gemcitabine/oxaliplatin as salvage therapy [IV, C]
• HDCT for recurrent ovarian GCTs may result in durable and prolonged remissions [IV, C]
• Any resectable residual disease should be removed, particularly for patients with normal serum marker and for patients with immature teratoma in order
to avoid the growing teratoma syndrome [III, A]
Early-stage SCSTs: management
• Stage IA granulosa cell tumour disease has an excellent prognosis after surgery alone and does not require adjuvant therapy [III, A]
• Adjuvant therapy should be considered for juvenile granulosa tumour stage IC patients [IV, B] or for AGCT stage IC2-IC3 patients [IV, C]. In these cases,
platinum-based ChT is the treatment of choice [III, A]
• For SLCTs, postoperative adjuvant ChT should be considered for patients with stage I poorly differentiated or heterologous elements (mesenchymal type)
[IV, B]
• BEP is the most commonly used regimen [III, A]. Alternative ChT options include paclitaxel and carboplatin [III, B], EP, CAP or platinum agent alone [III, A]
Advanced-stage and recurrent SCSTs: management
• Debulking surgery remains the most effective treatment of advanced or recurrent granulosa cell tumour [III, A]
• Platinum-based ChT is currently used for patients with advanced-stage SCSTs or recurrent disease [III, A]
• BEP regimen for three cycles or six cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel is recommended for postoperative ChT and patients with recurrent SCSTs [III, A]

Clinical Practice Guidelines

Table 7. Continued
• Patients with steroid cell tumours that are pleomorphic, large, at an advanced stage or with an increased mitotic count should be treated with additional

postoperative platinum-based ChT, either BEP (if not previously used) or a taxane–platinum combination [IV, C]
• Response to GnRH agonists, tamoxifen, progestin and AIs has been reported and could be an interesting option speciﬁcally for adult GCT [IV, B]
• For patients with persistent SLCTs, adjuvant ChT should be considered [III, B]

Early and advanced SCCOHT: management
• All suspected cases should beneﬁt from a review by an expert pathologist and be discussed in a specialised tumour board [V, A]
• Optimal treatment: a multimodal approach including ChT [III, B], radical surgery [IV, A], HDCT [II, C] and RT [IV, C]
• Debulking surgery (initial or interval) remains the most effective treatment [IV, A]
• Combination of a cisplatin- and etoposide-based therapy is the most appropriate for all stages [III, B]
• The use of pelvic RT, either concurrently or sequentially to HDCT and ASCT, may be considered for patients after surgery [IV, C]
• Efforts should be made to treat patients in a more homogeneous way through national and international networks [V, A]
Response evaluation and follow-up after initial treatment
• Serum tumour markers (hCG, a-FP, LDH, CA 125 and inhibin B) can correlate with tumour response during ChT [V, A]
• A CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis and chest (in case of suspected lung metastases) and pelvic ultrasound are the most common and useful imaging
techniques to evaluate the response to ChT [V, A]
• For GCT, follow-up visits must include history, physical examination with pelvic examination and tumour markers every 3 months for the ﬁrst 2 years,
then every 6 months during the third year and then yearly until progression [V, A]
• For SCSTs, follow-up visits including physical exam and tumour markers must be carried out every 6 months starting from the third year and this frequency
should be maintained indeﬁnitely [V, B]
• A pelvic ultrasound should be carried out every 6 months in those patients who have undergone fertility-sparing surgery, whereas a CT scan of the
abdomen and pelvis is carried out according to clinical indication
• PET scan for tumour response evaluation or follow-up is not yet recommended [V, D]
Fertility and hormone replacement
• Oocyte cryopreservation is an option for patients scheduled to receive ChT [V, C]
• Hyperstimulation followed by oocyte cryopreservation 12 months after the end of ChT is another option [V, C]
• Fertility preservation should not jeopardise the oncological management
• HRT may be used safely for many GCTs [V, A]
• An HRT approach should be avoided for SCST [V, D]

long-term morbidity. These tumours are highly chemosensitive but
grow rapidly and may grow back if there is a delay in starting ChT.
Platinum-based regimens have been the treatment of choice
and the 5-day-BEP regimen is the most widely used regimen [38].
While the optimal number of cycles of BEP has not been fully
established in randomised trials, three cycles of BEP for completely resected stage I disease and four cycles for those with more
advanced disease are recommended [III, A] [2, 39]. Bleomycin
should not be given to those > 40 years of age or with pre-existing
pulmonary disease, given the risk of drug-related lung injury with
an approximate mortality rate of 3% [III, A].
Alternative ChT regimens [POMB/ACE (cisplatin/vincristine/
methotrexate/bleomycin/actinomycin D/cyclophosphamide/etoposide) and CBOP/BEP (carboplatin/bleomycin/vincristine/cisplatin/BEP)] have been evaluated, particularly in high-risk
patients, reporting high activity and impacting toxicity: unfortunately, none of them has been compared with BEP in randomised
trials. A phase II Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) trial
reported high activity with an acceptable toxicity profile for a
carboplatin–etoposide combination in the adjuvant setting
of completely resected stages I–III dysgerminomas [40].

Volume 29 | Supplement 4 | October 2018

Dysgerminomas are very sensitive to RT; however, its use is limited to selected cases because of the negative impact on fertility.
In patients with platinum-sensitive relapse (progression
> 4–6 weeks after completion of ChT), ifosfamide/platinum (IP)
with or without paclitaxel (P) should be considered as secondline treatment [IV, C] [41]. Further active ChT regimens include:
vinblastine/ifosfamide/cisplatin (VeIP) and cisplatin/vinblastine/
bleomycin (PVB) [IV, C] [42]. Patients resistant to a cisplatinbased combination may receive vincristine/actinomycin D/cyclophosphamide (VAC) or paclitaxel/gemcitabine or gemcitabine/
oxaliplatin as salvage therapy [IV, C].
Although there is a role for ASCT in relapsed testicular cancer, it
is not the standard of care for women with relapsed or recurrent
malignant ovarian GCTs and its role remains undefined because of
the paucity of prospective data. A recent report suggests that
HDCT for recurrent ovarian GCTs may result in durable and prolonged remissions [IV, C]. In a retrospective series, Reddy
Ammakkanavar et al. [43] treated 13 patients with recurrent
malignant ovarian GCTs from 1990 to 2013. All patients had experienced disease progression after standard cisplatin combination
treatment. HDCT consisted of tandem courses of carboplatin

700 mg/m2 and etoposide 750 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) daily for
three consecutive days followed by stem cell infusion. Seven
patients achieved CR with four of these seven patients remaining
disease free at 12, 22, 120 and 270 months from treatment.
Any resectable residual disease should be removed, particularly
for patients with normal serum marker in which residual disease is
present on imaging after adjuvant therapy and for patients with
immature teratoma, to avoid growing teratoma syndrome [III, A].
The role of secondary cytoreductive surgery for patients with
recurrent or progressive ovarian GCT remains controversial.
Unlike males, females who have a relapse with malignant disease
after primary ChT for GCTs have a poor prognosis.
The role of the new targeted agents in GCTs is yet to be demonstrated. Targeted agents already investigated in testicular
tumours and of potential interest include tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and sunitinib) and anti-angiogenic agents (bevacizumab) [44]. These recent studies involving targeted therapies
have been inconclusive. Nevertheless, studies of the management of refractory GCTs are ongoing, with a focus on optimal
utilisation of HDCT and ASCT, as well as the role of immune
checkpoint inhibitors in refractory GCTs [45]. Studies aiming
to identify the patients who may benefit from more intensive
treatment up front to prevent the development of refractory disease are also in progress for testicular GCTs, and the results may
be useful for ovarian GCT patients [46].

Sex cord-stromal tumours
Debulking surgery, whenever feasible, remains the most effective
treatment for metastatic or recurrent granulosa cell tumours [III,

iv14 | Ray-Coquard et al.

Annals of Oncology
A]. Platinum-based ChT is currently used for patients with
advanced-stage SCSTs or recurrent disease, with an overall response
rate of 63%–80% [47]. Unfortunately, most patients with advanced
disease do not have durable remissions. Patients with advanced disease have poor prognosis and they are, therefore, treated with adjuvant therapy, although the data are very limited [IV, C]. The BEP
regimen for three cycles or carboplatin/paclitaxel for six cycles is currently recommended for adjuvant postoperative ChT and for
patients with recurrent SCSTs [III, A].
Patients with steroid cell tumours that are pleomorphic, large,
at an advanced stage or with non-operable residual disease or
with an increased mitotic count should be treated with additional postoperative platinum-based ChT, either with BEP (if
not previously used), or with a taxane-platinum combination
[IV, C].
The GOG is currently conducting a randomised phase II trial
of BEP versus the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin for
patients with newly diagnosed and ChT-naı̈ve recurrent metastatic SCSTs of the ovary [48].
Alternative ChT options include: PVB, EP, CAP, VAC and
weekly paclitaxel for relapsed patients after platins. There are limited data regarding the utility of ChT in patients with persistent
SLCTs, but responses in patients with measurable disease have
been reported [III, B].
Given the functional hormonal nature of granulosa cell
tumours that express steroid hormone receptors, there is some
rational for a hormone-based approach. Response to
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, tamoxifen,
progestin and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) has been reported. In a
recent review, Van Meurs et al. reported the results of 31 patients
treated with hormone therapy; a CR was described in 25.8% of
patients and a partial response in 45.2% [49]. Despite limited
available data, hormone therapy appears to be a useful alternative
treatment for patients with advanced-stage or recurrent AGCTs
[IV, B]. The role of AIs for relapsed granulosa cell tumours is
being assessed in the multicentre phase II PARAGON trial
(ANZGOG-0903).
Anti-angiogenic agents have also been investigated in patients
with recurrent AGCT, due to the overexpression of vascular
endothelial growth factor and vascularity of these tumours. A
recent study at the MD Anderson Cancer Center seems to confirm the potential activity of bevacizumab [response rate 17%,
stable disease (SD) 77%] [50], although the study was conducted
in only 36 patients [III, C]. The GINECO group (Groupe
d’Investigateurs Nationaux pour les Etudes des Cancers de
l’Ovaire) is currently conducting a phase II trial (ALIENORENGOT-ov7/GINECO), to explore the clinical benefit of adding
bevacizumab to weekly paclitaxel followed by bevacizumab as
maintenance versus weekly paclitaxel followed by observation in
patients with relapsed SCSTs [51].

Small cell carcinomas of the ovary hypercalcaemic
type
For selected patients with bulky stage III disease or stage IV disease
where primary debulking surgery is not considered to be achievable,
the use of neoadjuvant ChT may be considered on an individual
basis after discussion with the tumour board [IV, C].

Volume 29 | Supplement 4 | October 2018

Annals of Oncology
A combination of a cisplatin and etoposide-based therapy is
generally considered most appropriate [III, B] [22, 36]. As
reported in early stage, HDCT for patients who underwent a CR
(after surgery and/or ChT) with ASCT rescue has been proposed
and is associated with better prognosis [II, C] [23, 34, 37]. Even
with intensive regimens, prognosis remains dismal, and despite
frequent initial responses to ChT, relapses are frequent and tend
to be refractory to second-line ChT.
The management of relapsed disease is often very challenging,
and prolonged remissions are never achieved with second-line
ChT regimens usually used in small cell lung carcinomas. Several
schedules have been reported including the combination of
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine [V, B]. There are
anecdotal reports on carboplatin and paclitaxel including
dose-dense regimes, and topotecan has also shown some modest
activity as in small cell lung cancers [V, C]. To date, no targeted
therapies have been tested in SCCOHT. Second-line treatment is
likely to achieve short remission rates, and beyond that, patients
should be considered for phase I trials if they remain of good
performance status.

Follow-up, long-term implications and
survivorship
Response evaluation and follow-up programme for
post-ChT
Germ cell tumours. The surveillance follow-up programme for
patients not undergoing postoperative ChT has been detailed
previously. For patients undergoing ChT, serum tumour markers
(hCG, a-FP, LDH, CA 125 and inhibin B) can accurately correlate
with tumour response during ChT [V, A]. A CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis and chest (in case of suspected lung metastases) and
pelvic ultrasound are the most common and useful imaging techniques to evaluate the response to ChT in patients with measurable disease [V, A]. Approximately 75% of GCT recurrences occur
within the first year after initial management; the peritoneal cavity is the most common site of recurrence, while retroperitoneal
lymph node involvement is very uncommon. Given that the
majority of women with GCTs have an excellent survival
outcome, persistence of long-term effects of treatment is highly
significant. The most frequent side effects of BEP included pulmonary toxicity, decreased diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML),
neuropathy, Raynaud’s disease, tinnitus, high tone hearing loss,
gonadal dysfunction, cardiovascular disease/hypertension and
nephrotoxicity (Table 6). One of the most ominous late effects of
ChT, particularly for young survivors, is the risk of secondary
malignancies. Contrary to what is known for testicular cancer
survivors, no study so far has analysed the risk of a solid second
cancer in GCTs. Recently, the Cancer Registry of Norway has
reported the cumulative incidence of a second cancer in 10-year
GCT survivors [19]. A second cancer was diagnosed in 23 of 139
survivors who underwent cytotoxic treatment. Interestingly,
among these 23 cases, 18 had received abdominal RT and 16 of
them had their second malignancy occur below the diaphragm.
Three uterine tumours and two malignant melanomas occurred

Volume 29 | Supplement 4 | October 2018

Clinical Practice Guidelines
among 41 patients treated only with ChT. Due to the low number
of cases, the role of ChT in the development of second malignancies cannot be assessed.
Follow-up visits for GCT patients must include history, physical and pelvic examinations and exploration of tumour markers
every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months during the
third year and then yearly until progression [V, A]. Tumour
marker exploration can be avoided from the third year.
Sex cord-stromal tumours. Conversely, SCSTs have an indolent
course with tendency for late recurrence (the median time to
relapse is approximately 4–6 years), therefore patients with
SCSTs require long-term follow-up [47]. Several reports describe
relapses occurring more than 20 years (up to 37 years) after diagnosis. Common sites of recurrence are the upper abdomen
(55%–70%) and the pelvis (30%–45%).
In the case of SCSTs, follow-up visits including physical exam
and tumour marker exploration (e.g. inhibin B, AMH) must be
carried out every 6 months starting from the third year and this
frequency should be maintained indefinitely [V, B]. Pelvic ultrasound should be carried out every 6 months in those patients
who have undergone fertility-sparing surgery. CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be carried out when clinically indicated, based on symptoms or tumour marker elevation.
The use of PET scan for tumour response evaluation or followup is not well established yet, as this is not recommended in
GCTs [V, D].
Fertility preservation in non-epithelial ovarian cancer. Fertility
preservation should not jeopardise the oncological management.
For non-epithelial ovarian cancer, much of the literature on fertility has been focused on young women who harbour GCTs.
GCTs account for less than 5% of all ovarian malignancies and
are typically diagnosed in young females, at the peak of their
reproductive age. After introduction of cisplatin-based ChT,
most young women with GCTs treated according to the current
therapeutic approach will survive the disease. However, this success must be balanced against possible treatment-associated longterm adverse effects, gonadal dysfunction being among the most
feared. The likelihood of ChT-induced amenorrhoea is based on
the specific administered ChT, its cumulative drug dose and
duration of therapy. In general, cisplatin is viewed to be only
moderately gonadotoxic; a significant association between
increased cumulative doses of cisplatin-based ChT and reduced
gonadal function has been shown in males with germ cell cancer
[38]. Recently, the work published by Solheim et al. has shown a
similar dose-dependent risk of gonadal dysfunction in females
[19]. This group reports that the cumulative probability of
achieving pregnancy after treatment was significantly higher in
women who received no adjuvant treatment or no more than
three cycles of cisplatin-based ChT compared with those who had
> 3 cycles of cisplatin- or non-cisplatin-based postoperative
treatment. In addition, the fertility outcome, namely the return
of menstruation and ovulation, depends on age: the younger
the patient, the larger the reserve of oocytes harvested after ChT
[52]. The infertility rate reported among women attempting conception after treatment for GCTs is 5%–10% [26, 53] which is
almost comparable to the rate among age-matched women in

doi:10.1093/annonc/mdy001 | iv15

Clinical Practice Guidelines
the general population [54]. Nevertheless, oocyte cryopreservation is an option for patients scheduled to receive ChT [V, C].
The recommended approach is to postpone cancer treatment to
enable ovulation induction and oocyte aspiration. Whenever
possible, the retrieved oocytes should be in vitro fertilised prior
cryopreservation, with donor sperm offered to single patients
[55]. These frozen embryos may be used to achieve pregnancies if
ChT-related ovarian failures occur. Another approach is
controlled ovarian hyperstimulation followed by oocyte cryopreservation 12 months after the end of ChT, in the scenario of a
rapid decline in ovarian reserve [V, C]. However, due to the rarity
of GCTs, experience with this approach is limited.
There is an increasing evidence for efficacy in reducing premature ovarian insufficiency with the use of GnRH agonists in
patients with breast cancer undergoing ChT. However, there is
no evidence in other cancers and certainly none in these rare
diseases [56].

Hormone replacement therapy and contraception
ChT has long-term effects on gonadal function and may lead to
ovarian dysfunction and sterility. Factors such as cumulative
drug dose, duration of therapy and age at treatment influence the
incidence of ovarian failure function. Those patients who suffer
from iatrogenic menopause usually have more pronounced
symptoms in comparison with those following a naturally occurring menopause, mainly due to the sudden cessation of ovarian
hormone production and younger age. In this field, the GOG carried out an analysis evaluating the quality of life and the reproductive and psychosocial characteristics of survivors of GCTs
compared with matched controls [57]. At a median follow-up of
10.2 years, these women appeared to be free of any major physical
illnesses compared with matched controls. The only differences
consisted of higher rates of reported hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and hearing loss. Among chronic functional problems, numbness, tinnitus and Raynaud’s symptoms were
reported more frequently by survivors. In spite of persistence of a
few sequelae of treatment, in general, GCT survivors enjoy a
healthy life comparable to that of controls.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for germ cell and sex
cord ovarian malignancies is important to consider; most cases
occur in young premenopausal women who could enter the menopause as a consequence of radical treatment and would be
exposed to several decades of oestrogen deficiency. Symptoms of
iatrogenic menopause are usually more pronounced compared
with a regular menopause due to the sudden cessation of ovarian
hormone production, younger age and additional physical and
psychological symptoms associated with cancer therapy.
HRT is an effective treatment mainly used for the treatment of
vasomotor symptoms, low mood, sexual dysfunction and urogenital symptoms following the menopause. Moreover, it may
dramatically improve physical and psychological symptoms and,
in the end, the quality of life in cancer patients.
Although, there is no trial evaluating the use of HRT in germ
cell and sex cord ovarian cancer patients, it is generally considered that HRT may be used safely for GCTs [V, A]. In the case of
ovarian granulosa cell tumours and other sex cord-stromal
malignancies, e.g. SLCTs which are thought to be hormone

dependent, an HRT approach should be avoided following their
diagnosis [V, D].
Hormonal contraception is not contraindicated for women
diagnosed with GCTs receiving fertility-sparing treatment and
wanting to postpone or avoid pregnancies [V, B].
