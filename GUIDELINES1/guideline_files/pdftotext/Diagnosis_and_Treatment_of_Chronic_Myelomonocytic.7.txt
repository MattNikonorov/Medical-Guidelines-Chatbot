Abstract
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a disease of the elderly, and by far the most frequent overlap myelodysplastic/
myeloproliferative neoplasm in adults. Aside from the chronic monocytosis that remains the cornerstone of its diagnosis, the clinical
presentation of CMML includes dysplastic features, cytopenias, excess of blasts, or myeloproliferative features including high white
blood cell count or splenomegaly. Prognosis is variable, with several prognostic scoring systems reported in recent years, and treatment
is poorly deﬁned, with options ranging from watchful waiting to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which remains the only curative
therapy for CMML. Here, we present on behalf of the European Hematology Association and the European LeukemiaNet, evidence- and
consensus-based guidelines, established by an international group of experts, from Europe and the United States, for standardized
diagnostic and prognostic procedures and for an appropriate choice of therapeutic interventions in adult patients with CMML.
ing from those of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with
peripheral monocytosis, to very proliferative forms, characterized
by high white blood cell (WBC) counts, splenomegaly, and/or
other forms of extramedullary disease. Its diagnosis remains
largely based on morphology, though recent advances in ﬂow
cytometry of blood monocytes may contribute in difﬁcult cases.

Introduction
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is, by far, the most
frequent of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative entities recognized by World Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁcations1
with an incidence of about 1/100,000 per year. It is a very
heterogeneous disease, with hematological characteristics rang-

Somatic mutations in a small subset of recurrently mutated genes
can be detected in almost all patients, some carrying a poor
prognostic value. Treatment choices remain poorly supported,
since, until recently, CMML patients were included in MDS
series, whereas only 1 CMML-speciﬁc randomized clinical trial
(RCT) has ever been published to date.2
The European Hematology Association and the European
LeukemiaNet have convened an international program, involving
experts from Europe and the United States, aimed at developing
evidence- and consensus-based guidelines that provide clinical
practice recommendations for1 standardized diagnostic and
prognostic procedures and for2 an appropriate choice of
therapeutic interventions in adult patients with CMML. Herein,
we present our results.

Morphology
A precise diagnostic workup of patients with suspected CMML starts
with blood counts, a manual differential count with the assessment of
percentage and absolute number of monocytes and blasts (including
promonocytes) and immature myeloid cells (metamyelocytes,
myelocytes, and promyelocytes). An absolute monocyte count of
>1  109/L, accounting for more than 10% of leukocytes, is a
prerequisite for the diagnosis of any type of CMML.9,10 The latter is
important to differentiate CMML from atypical CML. If available,
antecedent blood counts should be collected to document that
monocytosis has been sustained for more than 3 months.
Bone marrow cytology using May-Grünwald or Wright-Giemsa
staining of marrow aspirates, accompanied by iron staining,
assessment of dysplasia in all lineages, calculation of percentage of
monocytes and blasts (including promonocytes)11,12 are mandatory. Peroxidase and esterase can also be useful. The percentage of
marrow and peripheral blasts allows classiﬁcation of CMML
according to WHO 2016 criteria as CMML 0 or 1 or 2 (Table 1),
and exclusion of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially M4
AML.13 Marrow monocytosis per se is not sufﬁcient for diagnosis
but should be assessed, as there is generally a correlation between
blood and marrow monocytosis. Distinguishing monocytes,
promonocytes, and monoblasts only on morphological grounds
can sometimes be extremely difﬁcult, but it is formally necessary,
and efforts should be made to distinguish them as much as
possible.12 In some cases, the degree of dysplasia of blood and
marrow can help distinguish between CMML and AML, as in
CMML dysplastic features are more pronounced in the megakaryocytic and granulocytic lineages. In addition, degranulated
myelocytes sometimes cannot be easily distinguished from
monocytes, potentially leading to confusion. In these cases,
peroxidase and esterase staining can be helpful.
Although cytology of marrow aspirates can often better assess
signs of single cell dysplasia, marrow biopsy is useful in the
diagnosis of CMML.14–16 It allows the assessment of cellularity,

Design and methods
Systematic review of the literature and synthesis of
evidence
English-language original and review articles published between
1985 and 2017 were systematically extracted from PubMed and
reviewed in working groups. The level of evidence was rated
according to the Revised Grading System for Recommendations in
Evidence-Based Guidelines of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines network Grading Review Group. Brieﬂy, meta-analyses and
systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCT were graded 1, systematic
reviews of case-control or cohort studies, case-control or cohort
studies were graded 2, nonanalytic studies (eg, case reports, case
series) were graded 3, and expert opinion was graded 4.

Consensus phase
Opinions between experts from Europe and the United States
were exchanged including via face-to-face meeting held twice a
year for 2 years from 2016 to 2018, and conﬂicts in
recommendations were resolved by case scenario studies
followed by anonymous electronic votes.
Recommendations were formulated and ranked according to the
supporting level of evidence. The level of recommendation was
graded according to the criteria of the Scottish Intercollegiate
Guidelines Network Grading Review Group. A recommendation
was rated as: A, when based on at least 1 meta-analysis, systematic
review, or RCT and directly applicable to the target population and
demonstrating overall consistency of results; B, when based on a
body of evidence including systematic reviews of case-control or
cohort studies, case-control or cohort studies directly applicable to
the target population and demonstrating overall consistency of
results or extrapolated evidence from meta-analysis, systematic
review or RCT; C, when based on extrapolated evidence from
studies rated as systematic reviews of case-control or cohort
studies, case-control or cohort studies; and D, when based on
evidence level 3 or 4. Recommendations for diagnostic work-up
were based on expert consensus (recommendation level D) and
graded as mandatory, recommended or suggested.

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for CMML according to World Health Organization 20161
Persistent monocytosis ≥1  109/L and monocytes ≥10% of WBC in peripheral
blood
No criteria and no previous history of CML, ET, PV, and PMF
If eosinophilia, neither PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1 rearrangements nor PMC1-JAK2
translocation
<20% Blasts in peripheral blood and BM aspirationa
≥1 Following criteria
Dysplasia in ≥1 myeloid lineage
Acquired clonal cytogenetic or molecular abnormality in hematopoietic cellsb
Monocytosis persistent for at least 3 months, with other causes excluded
CMML-0: <2% blasts in PB and <5% blasts in BM
CMML-1: 2–4% blasts in PB and/or 5–9% blasts in BM
CMML-2: 5–19% blasts in PB, 10–19% in BM, and/or Auer rods

Diagnostic procedures

BM = bone marrow, CMML = chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, CML = chronic myeloid leukemia,
ET = essential thrombocytemia, PMF = primary myeloﬁbrosis, PV = polycythemia vera, WBC = white
blood cell.

Blasts and blast equivalents include myeloblasts, monoblasts, and promonocytes.

The presence of mutations in genes often associated with CMML (eg, TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, SETBP1)
in the proper clinical contest can be used to support a diagnosis. It should be noted, however, that
many of these mutations can be age-related or be present in subclones. Therefore, caution would have
to be used in the interpretation of these genetic results.

The differential diagnosis of CMML includes all conditions that
cause a sustained monocytosis of >1  109/L in the peripheral
blood. These include reactive causes such as a number of chronic
infections3 and autoimmune disorders.4–6 Multiparameter ﬂow
cytometry analysis of peripheral blood monocytes can help
distinguish reactive monocytosis from CMML. The presence of

count neighboring the threshold of monocytosis, and MO1
accumulation frequently evolve to genuine CMML.32 The
combined analysis by ﬂow cytometry focusing on granulocytic
and erythroid dysplasia by an integrated analysis might
discriminate these MDS subgroups from CMML.22 Ongoing
prospective investigation may clarify the role and interest of
monocyte subset distribution analysis in MDS.
Finally, ﬂow analysis of monocyte subset distribution in the
peripheral blood can possibly be used as a biomarker to monitor
CMML response to standard and novel therapeutic regimen, for
example, patients who respond to hypomethylating agents
(HMAs) have normalization of the MO1 fraction,25 although
those results need conﬁrmation.

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. Complete blood count,
marrow aspirate with routine staining using May-Grünwald or Wright-Giemsa staining, and iron staining should
be mandatorily performed, while bone marrow biopsy with
Hematoxylin-Eosin and/or Gomori’s Silver staining, is
strongly recommended. Immunohistochemistry can be
added including CD34 and monocytic markers like
CD68, CD163, CD14, and CD16. A ﬁnal bone marrow
report should be made including both cytology and
histology (recommendation level D).

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. Analysis of peripheral
blood monocyte subset distribution by a multiparameter
ﬂow cytometry assay to distinguish CMML from reactive
monocytosis is recommended. Its diagnostic robustness in
the context of CMML and concomitant inﬂammatory
manifestations remains to be validated (recommendation
level D).

Flow cytometry immunophenotyping
Flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow cells may contribute to
CMML diagnosis, and potentially to prognosis, and treatment
monitoring by detecting subtle changes in antigen expression at
the surface of myelomonocytic cells and in the erythroid
lineage.19–23 Bone marrow cell immunophenotyping can similarly detect aberrations in CMML bone marrow.24 Recent data
suggest that ﬂow analysis of peripheral blood cells can greatly
contribute to the diagnosis and follow-up of CMML.25–28
In patients with peripheral blood monocytosis ≥1  109/L,
ﬂow cytometry analysis of monocyte subset distribution readily
distinguishes CMML from benign reactive monocytosis. The
fraction of classical monocytes (CD14+/CD16 ) referred to
MO1 can be distinguished from intermediate (CD14+/CD16+,
MO2) and nonclassical (CD14low/CD16+, MO3) monocytes
according to the current nomenclature of normal human
monocyte subsets.29,30 The proportion of MO1 is increased in
CMML patients, while being decreased in those with a reactive
condition.25,26 A proportion of MO1 ≥ 94% provides a
speciﬁcity and sensitivity both higher than 90% to distinguish
CMML for reactive monocytosis. This 94% cutoff has been
validated by independent groups25–28 and this assay has been
approved as a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendmentscertiﬁed clinical test in the United States.26 Similar standardization in European countries should be promoted.
Quantiﬁcation of the MO1 fraction as CD16-negative
monocytes by means of the HematoFlow technology (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA) could potentially be used in routine
practice.31 In patients with a suspected CMML but with a normal
monocyte subset distribution (and fewer than 94% MO1s),
molecular analyses and follow-up are required to conﬁrm
CMML diagnosis according to WHO 2016 criteria. Alternatively, a decreased MO3 subset combined with an increased MO2
fraction suggests the combination of CMML with an inﬂammatory condition.27,32 In the latter situation,8 correction of the
inﬂammatory manifestation (eg, with steroids) will reveal a
typical increase in MO1 fraction32 (Fig. 1).
Flow cytometry can also help distinguish CMML from
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) with monocytosis, especially polycythemia vera33 and primary myeloﬁbrosis.34 Such a
distinction may have therapeutic implications.27 The distinction
between CMML and MDS can be more complex and semantic, as
MDS with marrow monocytosis, peripheral blood monocyte

Cytogenetics
Chromosomal abnormalities in CMML have been reported in
10% to 40% of patients in published reports, the variability been
largely due to small numbers, inclusion criteria, and referral
patterns. Cytogenetic aberrations are not speciﬁc of CMML. The
most frequent are trisomy 8, and monosomy 7, while complex
karyotypes are infrequent.35–37 Presence of chromosomal
abnormalities is more common in patients with CMML-2.37
There is a strong association between speciﬁc cytogenetic
abnormalities and the risk of AML evolution and overall survival
(OS).38–40 The Spanish cytogenetic risk stratiﬁcation divided
karyotypic abnormalities into 3 risk groups according to OS:
patients with trisomy 8, chromosome 7 abnormalities or complex
karyotype with a very poor outcome (poor-risk category);
patients with normal karyotype or isolated loss of Y chromosome
with better OS (good-risk category); the remaining speciﬁc
chromosomal abnormalities being merged into an intermediaterisk category.39 The prognostic signiﬁcance of isolated trisomy 8
is, however, controversial. Investigators at MD Anderson Cancer
Center have proposed to reassign trisomy 8 to the intermediaterisk category based on the better OS of these patients, but around
50% of them evolved to AML.39,40 A Mayo Clinic-French
Consortium reassigned cases with monosomal karyotype as highrisk (85% of cases with complex karyotype also have a
monosomal karyotype) and isolated der(3) as low-risk abnormalities.41

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. Cytogenetic analysis is
mandatory in the diagnostic work-up of CMML, with
analysis of at least 20 mitoses. If an insufﬁcient number of
mitoses is obtained, or if only 1 or 2 metaphases with +8 or
7 are seen, ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
analysis with centromeric probes for chromosomes 7 and 8
is recommended (recommendation level D).

with a phenotypic continuum between JAK2-mutated CMML
and classical MPN.34,53,54 A similar genotypic continuum exists
between CMML and atypical CML with respect to SETBP1
mutations.55 Although not AML-deﬁning stricto sensu, NPM1
mutations in CMML tend to be associated with rapid progression
to AML,45,56,57 suggesting that NPM1-mutated CMML is in fact
very close to AML with monocytic differentiation (M4/5 AML).
Conversely, the presence of FLT3 ITD/TKD, present in <5%
CMML, does not necessarily herald transformation to AML, but
may be important to know for therapeutic purposes with the
recent advent of FLT3 inhibitors.58
Molecular genetics can also be used to document the clonal
origin of monocytosis and thus contribute to the deﬁnitive
diagnosis of CMML in patients with uninformative cytogenetics.
Identiﬁcation of somatic mutations may support the diagnosis of
CMML if 2 or more somatic mutations are present, or at least one
of them has high variant allele frequency (VAF), thereby reducing
the possibility of “clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential” (CHIP)59 occurring in the context of reactive monocytosis.
Because dysplasia is often subtle or absent in CMML, it is
important to emphasize the negative predictive value of normal
ﬁndings by both cytogenetic and molecular analyses with a largeenough gene panel (Table 2) to help exclude a diagnosis of CMML.
Mutational analysis of the 20 genes listed in Table 2 is best
achieved by targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panels.

Molecular genetics
An average of 10 to 15 somatic mutations can be found in the
coding regions of the genome in CMML patients.42 Compared to
MDS and AML,43 the mutational spectrum of CMML is more
homogeneous and sequencing of 20 genes can detect a clonal
abnormality in > 90% of cases44,45 (Table 2). The prototypical
molecular ﬁngerprint combines a mutation in a gene encoding an
epigenetic regulator (mainly TET2 and ASXL1) with a mutation
affecting the spliceosome machinery (SRSF2, less often SF3B1,
ZRSR2) with or without a mutation in the RAS/MAPK signaling
pathway (NRAS, KRAS, CBL, JAK2). In particular, the
combination of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations is very frequently
observed in CMML and was shown to be highly speciﬁc for
myeloid neoplasm with monocytosis.46 Signaling mutations are
more commonly seen in association with a proliferative
phenotype.44,45,47–65 Although prototypical patterns of cooccurrence of mutations have been reported,44,45,48–50 the
diagnostic46 or prognostic51 roles of mutation combinations in
CMML have yet to be validated.
According to the WHO 2016 criteria, molecular genetics is
required to exclude other myeloid neoplasms including chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML), the very rare myeloid/lymphoid
neoplasms with eosinophilia (MLN-eo), and “classical” MPNs.

a germline origin when they involve genes predisposing to
myeloid neoplasms (eg, RUNX1), especially in patients diagnosed with CMML at an early age (younger than 50) and/or in
those with a family history of myeloid neoplasm. In addition, the
possibility of CHIP should be considered for cases with single
gene mutations and low VAF, particularly when involving
DNMT3A, TET2, or ASXL1.
Genotype/phenotype correlations of recurrently mutated genes
have been reported45,64,65 and the prognostic role of gene
mutations interacts with that of clinical features.45,66 Nonsense
and frameshift mutations of ASXL1 have been invariably
associated with a poor prognosis.45,50,63,67–69 Other genes
reported to be associated with an adverse prognosis are
TET2,51,70,71SETBP1,50,72,73SRSF2,44,45RUNX1,44,45,50NRAS,45,47,50CBL,45,69 and EZH2.45,71,74 However, these published series must be interpreted with caution, because of the
limited power and heterogeneous therapeutic interventions in
these cohorts. In addition to genes frequently encountered in
CMML, analysis of IDH2 and IDH1 (further to that of FLT3)
may be useful for the rare CMML-2 cases harboring these
mutations because of emerging inhibitors (eg, enasidenib and
ivosidenib, respectively) for these abnormalities. The presence of
an FLT3-ITD or an NPM1 mutation should in fact lead to
reconsider the diagnosis of CMML, as M4/M5 AML can
masquerade initially as CMML, and intensive chemotherapy
could be considered. Despite emerging data in the context of
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT)75 or HMAs,76
molecular genetics cannot be currently used as a biomarker
for available therapies in CMML.

Studies carried out in MDS, which are likely relevant in CMML,
indicate that peripheral blood is as reliable as bone marrow for
mutational analysis.60 To date, there is no consensus on the
requirement or type of germline controls, analysis pipeline and
VAF cutoffs for the consideration of a pathogenic somatic variant
by NGS in myeloid neoplasms. The NGS report should exclude
polymorphisms or platform-speciﬁc sequencing artifacts. Of
note, some platforms report low-level false positive ASXL1
c.1934dupG (p.Gly646TrpfsX12) while others fail to detect it,
but this frequent lesion (up to 20% of patients) represents a bona
ﬁde genetic lesion in CMML.45 A recent study has suggested that
this variant is a real mutation when present at a ≥VAF 15%.61
More extensive gene panels may ﬁnd additional mutations, but
their signiﬁcance is uncertain and thus these panels should still be
considered mainly for research purposes.
The NGS report should mention the VAF, nucleic acid and
amino acid changes according to HGVS nomenclature62 of all
likely pathogenic variants. The nature of the somatic variant
can inﬂuence its prognostic relevance. In particular, missense
mutations in ASXL1 do not seem to carry the same prognostic
relevance as nonsense and frameshift mutations.45,63 Attention
should be paid to variants with allele frequencies compatible with

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. Analysis of 4 genes is
mandatory for risk assessment according to accepted risk
scoring systems (ASXL1, NRAS, RUNX1, and SETBP1;
Table 3) in patients eligible for transplant. Analysis of a
minimum of 20 genes (Table 2) is recommended for patients
being considered for active treatments including transplant.
It is suggested in patients only eligible for hydroxyurea (HY)
and supportive care to inform prognosis and/or reveal
actionable targets. The list includes IDH1, IDH2, NPM1,
and FLT3 that are mutated in <5% CMML but have
practical therapeutic implications (recommendation
level D).

(Table 2).47 Organomegaly should be assessed at least clinically,
and if splenomegaly is suspected, measured, for example, by
ultrasound, to monitor spleen size and volume. Organomegaly is
infrequent in patients with MD-CMML. A systematic search for
the optimal deﬁnition of MP-CMML remains to be undertaken but

points) to rapidly exclude CML, although CML very rarely
presents with >10% monocytes in the WBC differential count,
and generally has a higher percentage of circulating immature
myeloid cells than CMML. Classical MPN can also include
monocytosis, which typically does not show the abnormal
distribution of monocyte subsets observed in CMML.27
In the very rare cases with eosinophilia, FIP1L1-PDGFRA
should be excluded by polymerase chain reaction or FISH.77 Other
tyrosine kinase (TK) fusion genes that predict sensitivity to
imatinib78–80 or other inhibitors81 are almost always associated
with detectable cytogenetic rearrangements, whose ﬁnding direct
further molecular investigations.77 The very rare patients positive
for TK fusions should be reclassiﬁed as “Myeloid/lymphoid
neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA,
PDGFRB, or FGFR1, or with PCM1-JAK2” even if they otherwise
fulﬁll the diagnostic criteria for CMML.1 Testing for KIT D816V
mutation (and serum tryptase) helps to identify cases with systemic
mastocytosis associated with CMML if morphological analysis
suggests this association.82 Differentiating CMML from M4 AML
can be challenging and requires expert pathologic and/or
consensus review to accurately enumerate the promonocytes,
which should be added to the total blast percentage.12 Presence of
Auer rods or of an NPM1 mutation would favor diagnosis of M4
AML and suggest treatment with classical intensive chemotherapy.
Lastly, care must be taken to ensure that the monocyte count
constitutes >10% of the total peripheral differential as
proliferative cases of MDS/MPN-unclassiﬁable, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, and atypical CML (sometimes also typical CML)
can present with clonal, sustained monocytosis of >1  109/L.

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. CMML should be classiﬁed according to the WHO criteria, as revised in 2016,
including MD/MP-CMML categorization (recommendation level D).

Risk assessment
Disease-related factors
Risk assessment is a critical aspect of CMML management
because the disease is very heterogeneous, and median OS of
patients with CMML may range from over 50 months to <1
year.63,65 However, the prognostication of CMML patients is
challenging due to the large number of prognostic tools available
in the literature, including 9 models with external validation,35,50,63,65,87–91 and the wide prediction range when applying
several of these scores at the patient level. Most of these scores
combine “MDS-type” factors (including cytopenias, marrow
blast percentage, and karyotype), “MPN-type” factors (including
splenomegaly and other extramedullary disease, WBC count, and
presence of circulating immature cells), and, more recently,
somatic mutations. Although not extensively validated, some risk
stratiﬁcation can be achieved by determining the WHO subtype
(CMML-0, CMML-1, and CMML-2).1,13 The FAB classiﬁcation
can also be applied, as MD-CMML generally have a better
survival compared with MP-CMML patients.92 Although the 9
validated models all have slightly different variables and cutpoints incorporated, they generally include cytopenias (anemia,
thrombocytopenia), leukocytosis (monocytosis), and circulating
and/or marrow blasts. Complex karyotype and aberrations of
chromosome 7, and, more controversially, trisomy 8, are
associated with an adverse outcome.38,41 Regarding somatic
mutations, ASXL1 mutations have consistently and independently been associated with shorter OS.45,50,65,69ASXL1 status is
thus part of the GFM prognostic model.45 The number of
mutations also worsens prognosis.45 Recently RUNX1, NRAS,
and SETBP1 mutations were found to be independent adverse
prognostic factors of unfavorable survival and incorporated into
a molecular CMML Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS-mol).50 Of
note, prognostic scores in CMML have been established in
patients with a median age of at least 70 years, whose life
expectancy is inﬂuenced not only by the hematological disease
but also other causes. They should therefore be interpreted with
caution in younger patients, who have a longer life expectancy,
but in whom on the other hand CMML may induce a greater loss
of survival years, potentially prompting more intensive treatment.93 Additional work is required to propose a consensus
prognostic model for CMML and to overcome the limited
predictive power of current models.89

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. BCR-ABL1 rearrangement should be excluded in all cases. The very rare cases of
monocytosis with eosinophilia should be tested for FIP1L1PDGFRA rearrangement and other very rare TKs fusion
genes should be investigated if cytogenetic analysis indicates
a relevant rearrangement. M4 AML is also important to
rule out when CMML2 is suspected. Borderline cases must
be analyzed with NGS (including NPM1 gene status, which
must be urgently assessed when M4 AML is suspected) and
ﬂow cytometry (recommendation level D).

Diagnostic classiﬁcation
Clinical examination, morphology, cytogenetics, and, whenever
possible, ﬂow cytometry and molecular biology should be
integrated to classify patients according to WHO 2016 categories.
WHO classiﬁcation (Arber et al Blood 20161,9 includes CMML-0
for cases with <2% blasts in PB and <5% blasts in BM; CMML-1
for cases with 2% to 4% blasts in PB and/or 5% to 9% blasts in
BM; and CMML-2 for cases with 5% to 19% blasts in PB, 10% to
19% in BM, and/or when Auer rods are present (Table 1). This
stratiﬁcation holds prognostic signiﬁcance.13
The distinction between “dysplastic” CMML (MD-CMML)
and “proliferative” CMML (MP-CMML) initially proposed by the
French-American-British (FAB) classiﬁcation83 based on a WBC
cutoff of 13  109/L) remains useful, as their clinical features differ
(cytopenias vs organomegaly, high WBC, and constitutional
symptoms), and consequently, their clinical management.84–86
MD-CMML, however, often progresses to MP-CMML, and this
progression is frequently concomitant with occurrence of signal

Monitoring patients and criteria for response
to treatment

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. All patients should have
a detailed risk stratiﬁcation assessment with any of the
following CMML-speciﬁc models incorporating mutational
analysis: (a) the GFM CMML model, (b) the CPSS-mol, or
(c) the Mayo Molecular Model (Table 3). If mutational
proﬁling is not available, we recommend any of the clinical
CMML-speciﬁc scores including (1) CPSS or (2) MDAPS
(recommendation level D).

Most clinical studies performed in CMML patients have evaluated
response according to the MDS International Working Group
(IWG) 2000 and 2006 criteria.104,105 These criteria can accurately
capture correction of bone marrow blast excess and cytopenias,
but not changes in myeloproliferative features such as correction of
hyperleukocytosis and monocytosis, reduction in spleen size, and/
or regression of extramedullary disease. An international panel has
proposed MDS/MPN response criteria that take myeloproliferative features in consideration.106 They also take into account
myeloﬁbrosis,14 and disease-related symptoms via the MPN-SAF
scoring system.107 Overall, the MDS/MPN-speciﬁc criteria have
more stringent deﬁnitions of complete remission and progressive
disease than the MDS IWG criteria. Though these criteria represent
an improvement for CMML and have been validated in a small
retrospective cohort,108 future prospective validation is warranted.
The relevance of improvements in hyperleukocytosis and monocytosis on long-term outcome and/or quality of life, and the
adequacy of the MPN-SAF scale for general symptoms assessment
in CMML require detailed investigation. Further investigation of
symptom assessment and quality of life tools are warranted in
CMML. In clinical practice, we recommend monitoring patients
with a CBC and differential, assessment of splenomegaly and
extramedullary disease (serous effusions, skin lesions, etc.), and
evaluation of general symptoms with a standardized questionnaire
such as the MPN-SAF. If splenomegaly is present, repeated
measures of spleen volume with the same morphological test are
preferable by ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, or
computed tomography scan (considering the risk of radiation
exposure). Finally, a bone marrow examination with cytogenetic
proﬁling should be performed if a change in the above evaluation is
identiﬁed.39 There is currently no formal data to recommend a
repeat mutational panel during follow-up.75 With respect to
pivotal phase 3 clinical trials, we recommend as primary endpoints
robust criteria such as OS, progression-free survival, or event-free
survival and incorporation of the MDS/MPN criteria as secondary
endpoints. Phase 2 clinical trials utilizing the MDS/MPN IWG
criteria as the primary endpoint should be analyzed with caution,
particularly when interpreting the proportion of patients whose
response is improvement of myeloproliferative symptoms.

Patient-related factors
Besides clinically relevant parameters, different factors related
both to individual general health status and to individual
expectations may affect clinical outcome and should be
considered for risk assessment and treatment allocation in
patients with CMML. These include age, functional ability
(performance status), comorbidities, physical reserves (frailty),
nutritional status and cognition, and quality of life.
Older age is an independent adverse prognostic factor in
CMML,45,69,91,94 and has been associated with adverse
outcome after treatment, including HMAs and allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Because
CMML is a malignancy typically occurring in elderly people
(median age around 77 years)95 favorable inﬂuence of younger
age for longer survival, together with good performance status
and absence of major comorbidities, currently appears to be
mainly related to the patient feasibility for an HSCT, which still
represents the only potentially curative treatment option.93
However, chronological age may be distinct from biological or
functional age, and additional factors should be considered
when evaluating the eligibility of patients to disease-modifying
treatments. Geriatric assessment tools should be evaluated in
CMML patients.96
Measurement of individual performance status has been applied
to patients with hematologic malignancy, including CMML, and
used as a selection criterion to undergo intensive treatments or to
enter clinical trials.97 A high prevalence of comorbidities has been
reported in patients with MDS or MDS/MPN. Sorror et al
developed the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity
Index as an instrument to assess pretransplantation comorbidities.98 This scoring system was validated in independent cohorts of
patients with CMML and can be used in predicting posttransplantation outcomes and stratifying CMML patients.99–101
Several comorbidity scores have been tested in the general MDS
patient population. These include general measures, such as the
Charlson comorbidity index or the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation27, and disease-speciﬁc measures, such as the MDS-Speciﬁc
Comorbidity Index. Although none of these indices was validated
in independent cohorts of CMML patients, general criteria issued
for MDS may be adopted as translated evidence.102,103

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. While response to treatment can be evaluated by IWG 2006 criteria in MDCMML, recently proposed ad hoc MDS/MPN criteria
should be preferably adopted (recommendation level D).
With respect to pivotal phase 3 clinical trials, we
recommend robust primary endpoints such as OS,
progression-free survival, or event-free survival, and
incorporation of the MDS/MPN criteria as secondary
endpoints (recommendation level D).

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. Based on the available
evidence, the Expert Panel agreed that the prognostic
relevance of factors related to individual general health
status may have important implications in the management
of patients with CMML, and accounting for both diseaseand patient-related factors improves risk stratiﬁcation and
clinical decision making (recommendation level D).

Treatment
After risk assessment, the patient’s eligibility for allogeneic SCT
should ﬁrst be assessed (Figs. 2 and 3). Nontransplant treatment
strategies discussed below are summarized in Figure 4.

Watchful-waiting strategy
Many CMML patients without (or with only mild asymptomatic)
cytopenias or major signs of myeloproliferation may, like MDS,
be observed without treatment. There are no demonstrated
thresholds to start treatment for cytopenias. For anemia, as for
MDS, Hb levels <10 g/dL are generally poorly tolerated by
elderly patients and tend to trigger treatment onset. For
thrombocytopenia, treatment is generally triggered when the
platelet count falls below 30  109/L or in case of bleeding
symptoms. There is no demonstrated WBC threshold to start

Figure 4. Treatment strategies in patients not candidates for transplant.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation

(IC) is still not clear, considering the absence of randomized
prospective trials. Two recent retrospective studies have
demonstrated that pre-HSCT therapy with azacitidine (AZA)
in MDS patients, including CMML, may allow for similar
outcomes after HSCT compared to pretreatment with IC.115,116
Nevertheless, as the rate of complete remissions is generally
higher with IC compared to HMA,111 IC might be the best option
in selected, medically ﬁt patients, with a high disease burden.
Treatment with HMA before HSCT might be considered mainly
for unﬁt and “comorbid” patients and as a “bridging strategy” to
HSCT in those where no donor has been identiﬁed yet.117 HMA
may also be considered as a preferable option in patients with
mutated TET2 and wild type ASXL1 who appear to have a
higher response rate to HMAs, including in CMML.76,118

Currently available therapeutic agents can lead to survival
prolongation but no cure of CMML. Therefore, allogeneic HSCT
is increasingly used as a curative treatment option.110 Moreover,
nonrelapse mortality after HSCT has decreased signiﬁcantly in
more recently performed HSCT, including patients up to the age
of 70 years.111 The main questions are which patients with
CMML might beneﬁt from HSCT and when should transplant be
recommended. Patient-related and disease-related factors should
be considered. We refer to the recently published review on HSCT
in MDS and CMML for the general patient-related factors,
including age, performance status (functional ability), frailty
(reduced physical ﬁtness or physical reserve), and comorbidities.112,113 Prognostic tools, including performance status (eg,
Karnofsky score), and HSCT-speciﬁc comorbidity index should
be considered as well.112,114 We agreed to use the CMML-speciﬁc
scoring system (CPSS)87 for the recommendation of HSCT for all
CMML patients, but IPSS-R may also be used for patients with
MD-CMML. The relatively poor survival after HSCT in CMML
(compared with MDS) suggests that new transplantation
strategies must be developed for these patients, including posttransplant strategies to prevent relapse.

Source of hematopoietic stem cells. G-CSF stimulated blood stem
cells (PBSC) are preferred and predominantly used in current
practice.110 PBSC are associated with a faster engraftment and a
lower relapse rate through graft-versus-leukemia effect, caused
by the higher number of T cells in the apheresis products.
However, PBSCs are associated with higher incidence of chronic
GvHD compared with bone marrow. According to a recent
randomized study in patients with hematological malignancies
(including MDS) undergoing bone marrow transplantation with
unrelated donors, the rate of severe chronic GvHD was
signiﬁcantly reduced compared with PBSCs.119 This approach
might still be an option, especially in patients who are expected to
be sensitive to GVHD-related morbidity. In the absence of a
matched related or unrelated donor, alternative donors may be
considered in the context of a clinical trial, including haploidentical donors that have emerged as an interesting option.120

Remission induction therapy before allogeneic hematopoietic
SCT. Lower tumor burden prior to HSCT minimizes the risk of
post-HSCT relapse and improves disease-free survival. Large
retrospective analyses have demonstrated improved outcomes for
patients transplanted in complete remission compared to those
with active disease at the time of HSCT,111 although these
analyses are hampered by a certain selection bias for patients with
chemo-sensitive disease and do not take into consideration
patients who did not undergo HSCT because of therapy-related
toxicity. Therefore, the value of prior induction chemotherapy

WBC lower than 13  109/L. In Europe, only AZA is licensed in
CMML and its labeling restricted to CMML-2 patients with
WBC < 13  109/L on the basis of a phase 3 MDS trial where
only 11 CMML patients were randomized.130
Following these licenses, a number of retrospective series of 10
to 150 patients have been reported with AZA and DAC.131–137
Phase 2 trials have also explored prospectively the activity of
HMAs in CMML in cohorts of 10 to 40 patients.127,138–144
Overall, these series have reported a weighted mean of ∼50%
overall and ∼25% complete response rates by MDS IWG criteria,
and a median OS of ∼20 months. The proportion of MP-CMML
in these trials was highly variable and no meta-analysis has been
performed. Several studies indicate that MP-CMML still has
shorter survival than MD-CMML when treated with
HMAs,132,133 but there is no obvious trend correlating response
to HMAs in CMML with the extent of myeloproliferation.134,137
Indeed, retrospective and prospective data indicate that both
AZA and DAC can reduce myeloproliferative features, including
normalization of WBC, improvement of splenomegaly, and
extramedullary skin lesions.108,131,138,145 Retrospective comparisons of patients treated with AZA versus DAC do not provide
data to support the choice of one HMA over the other.76,134
Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity has been reported in 15% to
55% of the patients, including up to 15% infections.137,139 These
ﬁgures compare favorably with those seen in MDS.130 This could
be due to lower toxicity notably the less frequent occurrence of
neutropenia in patients with MP-CMML, although there is no
data correlating myeloproliferative features and toxicity to
HMAs in CMML.
In patients eligible for HSCT, as mentioned above, the role of
HMA prior to transplant is disputed, especially as CMML were
often analyzed together with MDS.
In MP-CMML patients ineligible for HSCT, a retrospective
comparison suggests a survival beneﬁt of HMA over HY, and
previous HY exposure seems to reduce the response rate to
HMAs137 but this requires prospective conﬁrmation, especially
with the ongoing DACOTA trial (NCT02214407, EudraCT:
2014-000200-10), a European phase III trial randomizing
frontline DAC versus HY in MP-CMML with adverse features
(signiﬁcant cytopenias, high neutrophil count, blast excess or
splenomegaly, deﬁned according to a previous randomized trial
of HY in MP-CMML2).
Biomarkers of HMA activity are scarce and few studies have
speciﬁcally explored CMML cases. The impact of genomic,
epigenomic, or transcriptomic features have yet to be validated
and cannot yet guide routine practice.138,146–148 In a retrospective series of 174 patients, patients with TET2mut/ASXL1wt
genotypes had the highest rates of complete and overall response,
but with limited survival beneﬁt. Conversely, patients with
RUNX1 or CBL mutations had shortened survival compared
with other genotypes.76 The experience with novel HMAs such as
oral AZA149 and guadecitabine150 is too limited in CMML to
recommend their use outside of clinical trials. Half of patients
with primary or secondary HMA failure transform to AML and
overall, the prognosis of CMML after HMA failure is very poor,
with a median survival of around 7 months. Data on a very small
cohort of CMML patients suggest that there is no beneﬁt in
switching from AZA to DAC after AZA failure.151
In patients ineligible for transplant, AZA should be used
according to its label in MD-CMML-2. Off-label use of AZA in
patients with CMML-1 according to WHO 2016 with signiﬁcant
cytopenias, notably thrombocytopenia, should be considered. In
MP-CMML, HMAs should be envisaged in patients with a blast

TBI-based, regimens are considered standard of care mainly in ﬁt
CMML patients.112 Addition of ATG is recommended in case of
matched unrelated donor and MAC according to a randomized
study.121 The introduction of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC)
has broadened the use of allogeneic SCT for CMML patients with
advanced age and comorbidities through reduced tissue damage,
toxicity, and the risk of acute GvHD. However, RIC is associated
with less effective reduction of “CMML burden” resulting in an
increased rate of relapse.122,123 A randomized study comparing
RIC versus MAC in MDS and CMML showed similar outcome
after both conditioning regimens.124,125

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. HSCT is recommended
for patients below the age 70 with a donor and no major
contraindication to transplant who have higher-risk
CMML according to CMML-speciﬁc prognostic scoring
systems described above (Figs. 2 and 3). Transplant may be
considered in selected lower-risk patients with poor
prognostic factors that include severe cytopenias, several
poor-risk somatic mutations (especially ASXL1, RUNX1,
SETBP1, NRAS) (recommendation level B). Cytoreductive
treatment before HSCT is generally advocated in CMML-2
(level of evidence 2, recommendation level D).

Remission induction chemotherapy
There is a limited published dataset for intensive chemotherapy
(IC) in patients with CMML. The main goal of IC is to reduce
bone marrow blasts and aim for complete remission.105 CMML
is a fundamentally chemoresistant disease which does not appear
to be curable with IC alone. Single center series describe poor
long-term outcomes irrespective of the IC regimen, despite
achieving up to 40% CR rate. Remission duration is short, and
relapse appears inevitable, even when regimens are intensiﬁed.126
On the other hand, as mentioned above, IC is generally
recommended before HSCT for “short-term control” in patients
with an excess of marrow blasts (especially CMML-2), despite
the absence of prospective trials clearly demonstrated the role of
IC in this context. When considering intensive chemotherapy as a
“bridge to transplant,” however, the beneﬁts should be weighed
against the risks of complications (eg, infections) or organ
damage that may delay or deﬁnitively impair HSCT. IC may also
be considered in CMML-2 with severe cytopenias, rapidly
evolving disease, especially when the differential diagnosis
between CMML-2 and M4 AML appears difﬁcult, such as the
presence of Auer rods and/or an NPM1 mutation.
PANEL RECOMMENDATION. Intensive IC is not
recommended in patients with CMML, except in CMML2 patients as a bridge to HSCT, or when the disease appears to
be very close to M4 AML (presence of Auer rods, NPM1
mutation; evidence level 3, recommendation level D).

Hypomethylating agents

CMML in the United States based on pivotal MDS phase 3 trials
including <20 CMML patients each.127–129 Most patients had

factors (low endogenous serum erythropoietin [EPO] level and
low red blood cell [RBC] transfusion requirements), the only
published series on the use of ESAs speciﬁcally in CMML is
that of the Spanish and German MDS groups including 94
CMML patients.152 Erythroid response (ER) was observed in
64% of patients and RBC transfusion independence in 31%, in
keeping with the results of ESAs in lower-risk MDS.153,154 The
median duration of ER was 7 months, which seems shorter
than responses obtained in MDS.153,154 CPSS and EPO levels
were signiﬁcantly associated with ER in multivariate analysis.
Considering only patients with CPSS low- or intermediate-1risk group, the absence of RBC transfusion dependence (RBCTD) and EPO level predicted ER. Achievement of ER correlated
with a better survival.152 Challenging neutropenia is extremely
infrequent in untreated CMML. Severe neutropenia in
patients treated with cytoreductive drugs should be
addressed by tapering and/or interrupting the drug. There is
no data to support the safe use of G-CSF in CMML patients
with HMA-induced neutropenia, although its administration
could be considered in febrile patients not responding to
antibiotics.

excess (CMML-1/2) and cytopenias or signiﬁcant myeloproliferation, including extramedullary disease, until results of the
ongoing DACOTA trial are available. In patients eligible for
transplant, it is unclear when HMA should be used before
transplant, especially compared with IC.

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. In patients ineligible for
transplant, AZA should be considered according to its label
in MD-CMML with more than 10% of blasts (evidence level
2, recommendation level B). Use of AZA in patients with a
blast excess >5% and signiﬁcant cytopenias or myeloproliferation should be considered, preferably within clinical trials
(evidence level 3, recommendation level D). In patients
eligible for transplant, it is unclear when HMA should be
used before transplant, especially compared with IC.

Low-dose chemotherapy
Most MP-CMML patients with signiﬁcant leukocytosis or
organomegaly are still treated with low-dose cytoreductive
therapy, mainly HY. Despite its very limited disease-modifying
activity, HY remains the reference of cytoreductive therapy used
in this setting, notably following a randomized study that showed
its superiority over oral etoposide in elderly patients with MPCMML and high-risk features. In that trial, low-dose HY (1 g/d)
gave higher response rates and better survival than etoposide
(150 mg/wk), with median OS of 20 and 9 months, respectively.2
The decision to introduce HY therapy requires an assessment
of the potential beneﬁt of controlling the white cell count (and
perhaps the catabolic symptoms associated with this high count),
versus the potential worsening of cytopenias, especially in
patients with elevated but stable WBC. Development and
validation of dedicated symptom scores would be instrumental
in that aspect. HY should be tapered or withheld in case of onset
or aggravation of transfusion dependency.
Although it has no obvious impact on the abnormal clone(s)
size,53 HY is still widely employed in proliferative CMML,
especially before the use of HMA. As mentioned above, an
ongoing European randomized study compares HY with DAC in
MP-CMML with high-risk features (DACOTA trial,
NCT02214407, EudraCT: 2014-000200-10), and its results
are not yet available. Finally, therapy with HY does not seem to
affect the outcome of patients who later undergo HSCT.

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. Speciﬁc CMML scoring
systems, RBC transfusion requirement, and serum EPO
levels are adequate tools to select CMML patients with
symptomatic anemia who may beneﬁt from treatment with
ESA. A signiﬁcant ER to ESA is expected in anemic patients
with lower risk per CMML scoring systems and a low
endogenous serum EPO level (evidence level 2, recommendation level B).

Red cell transfusion and iron chelation therapy
Red cell transfusion. Registry data show that 35% CMML
patients at diagnosis have a hemoglobin concentration <10 g/dL,
with 20% meeting the “MDS” deﬁnition of RBC-TD.87
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data
demonstrate that 60% patients with CMML receive red cell
transfusions.155 Red cell transfusion is indicated for the
management of symptomatic anemia in CMML, either in the
absence of suitable disease-modifying therapy or in conjunction
with active therapeutic intervention. In general, guidelines for red
cell transfusion in CMML reﬂect the recommendations for
MDS,154 particularly for MD-CMML which often has a natural
history that mirrors lower-risk subtypes of MDS. However, for
MP-CMML, some speciﬁc features may inﬂuence red cell
transfusion strategy including:

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. HY is recommended in
proliferative CMML, in the absence of major cytopenias or
excess of marrow blasts (evidence level 2, recommendation
level A). No single level of WBC count or spleen size can be
recommended as being the optimal level to introduce
treatment. The decision should be based on the patient’s
symptoms and comorbidity.

1. The catabolic symptoms associated with proliferative CMML
are analogous to those of myeloproliferative disease. As such
fatigue and weight loss may contribute to general malaise
independently of the symptoms of anemia.
2. Proliferative CMML may be associated with splenomegaly.
Splenic pooling may necessitate larger volume red cell
transfusion to achieve symptomatic beneﬁt at any given
hemoglobin concentration.
3. Cytoreductive therapy aimed at controlling myeloproliferation may worsen anemia thereby necessitating supportive red
cell transfusion independent of the natural history of the
disease-associated anemia.

Other treatments including hematopoietic growth
factors
While erythropoietic stimulating factors (ESA) are generally the
ﬁrst-line treatment of lower-risk MDS, with known prognostic

All 3 of these features may render red cell transfusion less
effective for symptomatic relief of anemia in the proliferative
CMML subtype, but deﬁnitive data are lacking.

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. A short steroid course
may be attempted in CMML when a peripheral immune
component is suspected, notably patients with severe
thrombocytopenia contrasting with the absence of anemia
in the absence of an excess of marrow blasts (level of
evidence 3, recommendation level D).

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. Best practice currently
individualizes hemoglobin thresholds based on a combination of patient comorbidities (cardiac, respiratory),
symptoms at a given Hb concentration, observed
symptomatic beneﬁt from a (series of) transfusion episodes
and patient preference. (i) Hemoglobin <80 g/L is typically
symptomatic and should be considered to trigger RBC
transfusion, but no consistent single hemoglobin threshold
can be recommended. (ii) No consistent single hemoglobin
target value can be recommended. (iii) Transfusion
frequency should reﬂect the duration of symptomatic
beneﬁt between transfusion episodes. (iv) If transfusion
frequency and number of units per transfusion episode
is steadily increasing, consideration should be given to
other causes of anemia (eg, hypersplenism, bleeding,
hemolysis) or to disease progression (recommendation
level D).

Other and new drugs
Few phase I/II trials are exploring novel agents selectively in
CMML (or in MDS/MPN). These include drug classes such as
oral TPO agonists (eltrombopag, NCT02323178), JAK2
inhibitors (ruxolitinib, NCT01776723), farnesyltransferase
inhibitors (tipifarnib, NCT02807272), histone deacetylase
inhibitors (teﬁnostat, EudraCT 2015-002281-23), or the GMCSF cytokine (lenzilumab, NCT02546284). However, a broader
range of drug classes are being explored in more advanced,
registration trials designed for MDS and/or AML, but that can
include CMML subsets. This is for instance the case for the
second-generation HMA guadecitabine (NCT02907359). Because the molecular spectrum of CMML is closely related to that
of other myeloid neoplasms, trials exploring IDH inhibitors or
spliceosome inhibitors (H3B-8800, NCT02841540) may be
open to CMML.

Iron chelation therapy. There are no studies speciﬁcally assessing
the role of iron chelation therapy (ICT). As such it seems
reasonable to recommend the same options as for MDS, adapted
for CMML.

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. Inclusion of CMML
patients in clinical trials is strongly encouraged at all stages
of the disease. Academic, international CMML-speciﬁc
conﬁrmatory trials of activity signals detected in early phase
trials having only registered a minority of CMML patients
should be encouraged (recommendation level D).

PANEL RECOMMENDATION. ICT may be considered
for red cell transfusion-dependent patients with CMML
belonging to lower-risk categories of speciﬁc CMML
scoring systems and a serum ferritin level higher than
1000 ng/mL after approximately 25 units of red cell, in the
absence of patient-related (non-MDS) factors anticipated to
reduce life expectancy to <3 years (evidence level 3,
recommendation level D).

Conclusion
Despite an increasing knowledge on the molecular and cellular
features of CMML, the clinical management of these overlap
MDS/MPN syndromes remains poorly codiﬁed. The present
recommendations often rely on expert opinions, and/or extrapolations of MDS or MPN guidelines.
The inclusion of patients in clinical trials is strongly
encouraged to obtain the maximal information on safety and
efﬁcacy of new treatments. The inclusion of patients in national
and international registries is also encouraged to obtain data on
the disease and on the implementation of treatment strategies in
everyday clinical practice and to establish an optimal frame for
biological and translational studies. The recently established
international collaborative networks69,106,157 established in
CMML will be instrumental in unifying the existing prognostication tools and in conducting CMML-speciﬁc clinical trials,
to clarify the management strategy of CMML in the coming
years.

Management of thrombocytopenia
Hypersplenism may contribute to thrombocytopenia in CMML
patients with splenomegaly. Thrombocytopenia can also have a
peripheral component in CMML, and this may be suspected
notably when there is severe thrombocytopenia contrasting with
the absence of anemia or excess of marrow blasts. Immune
thrombocytopenia-like treatments, may be attempted in those
cases, sometimes with success.156 Thus, a short steroid course
may be envisaged in those cases. A trial of the thrombopoietin
(TPO) agonist eltrombopag is ongoing in thrombocytopenic
CMML-0
patients
(EudraCT
2013-001779-19,
NCT02323178). Use of TPO mimetics outside of clinical trials
in CMML is not recommended. Otherwise, the recommendations for platelet transfusion should be per the guidelines for
MDS.154
