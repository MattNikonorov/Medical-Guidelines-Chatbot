Prostate cancer basics

The prostate is a gland located deep
inside the lower abdomen. Anyone
with a prostate has a chance of
getting prostate cancer. It’s usually
not fatal, particularly early-stage
prostate cancer. This chapter offers
an overview of this common cancer.

What is prostate cancer?
Prostate cancer develops in a small gland
called the prostate. The prostate is part
of the male reproductive system. Besides
the prostate, the male reproductive system
includes the penis, seminal vesicles, and
testicles. The prostate is located deep
inside the lower part of the trunk of the
body, just below the bladder.
Prostate cancer develops when cells in the
gland start to grow out of control.

What is prostate cancer?

What is cancer?
Cancer is a disease where cells—the building
blocks of the body—grow out of control. This
can end up harming the body. There are many
types of cells in the body, so there are many
types of cancers.
Cancer cells don’t behave like normal cells.
Normal cells have certain rules. Cancer cells
don’t follow these rules.
•

Cancer cells develop genetic errors
(mutations) that allow them to multiply and
make many more cancer cells. The cancer
cells crowd out and overpower normal
cells. Cancer cells take away energy and
nutrients that normal cells need.

•

Normal cells live for a while and then die.
Cancer cells avoid normal cell death. They
survive much longer than normal cells do.

•

Cancer cells can spread to other areas of
the body. They can replace many normal
cells and cause organs to stop working
well.

•

Treatment may get rid of cancer at first but
sometimes the cancer comes back later.

•

Cancer can stop responding to treatment
that worked before.

Scientists have learned a great deal about
cancer. As a result, today’s treatments work
better than treatments in the past. Also, many
people with cancer have more treatment
choices now than before.

of prostate cancer. Genetic abnormalities
that aren’t inherited can occur, too.

Many people who develop cancer wonder
where it came from and how they got it.
Doctors don’t know exactly what causes
prostate cells to grow out of control (become
cancerous). But several factors are linked to
a higher risk of prostate cancer. These are
called risk factors. A risk factor is anything that
increases your chance of getting cancer.
Risk factors don’t necessarily cause prostate
cancer, but people with prostate cancer usually
have one or more of these risk factors:


Age – The biggest risk factor for prostate
cancer is age. Prostate cancer is
diagnosed most often in those aged 65
years and above. Your chances of getting
prostate cancer increase as you become
older.



Family history – Your family health
history is information about the diseases
and health conditions in your family. A
family history reflects a pattern of certain
diseases among family members. With
prostate cancer, males who have a close
family member (a brother or father) with
this disease have a greater chance of
getting it themselves. Those with a family
history of certain other cancers (breast,
ovarian, colon, pancreatic, and other
cancers) are also at a higher risk for
prostate cancer.



Race – Black males are more likely than
White males to develop prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer in Black males is also
more likely to occur at an earlier age and
be more aggressive and more advanced
when diagnosed. Black males are also
twice as likely to die from prostate cancer
compared with White males. Lack of
equal access to health care is a major
factor contributing to these differences.



Diet and lifestyle – Eating food that’s
high in fat, such as meat and dairy
products, has been linked with an
increased risk of prostate cancer. Eating
more fruits and vegetables may reduce
this risk. Exercise also likely decreases
the likelihood of dying from prostate
cancer. However, smoking may increase
the risks of developing prostate cancer
and of dying from it.

These risk factors aside, anyone with a
prostate has a risk of getting prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in
American males besides skin cancer.

Genetic factors – When a family history
shows that prostate cancer “runs in the
family,” genetic testing can be done to find
specific genetic abnormalities (mutations)
known to be linked with prostate cancer
or other cancers. For instance, a man
with an inherited genetic abnormality in
the BRCA2 gene likely has a higher risk

Prostate cancer basics

What causes prostate cancer?

The prostate enlarges with age
A young man’s prostate is said to be the size of a walnut or a ping-pong ball and weigh about
the same as an AA battery. As you grow older, your prostate gradually grows larger, possibly
reaching the size of a lemon or an orange.
Having an enlarged prostate is a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Benign
means it’s not cancerous. An enlarged prostate doesn’t cause prostate cancer or increase
your risk of getting it. However, it’s common to have an enlarged prostate and prostate cancer
at the same time. Notably, an enlarged prostate can cause the same symptoms as those
caused by prostate cancer.
Doctors aren’t sure what causes the prostate to grow as men get older. A common theory is that
levels of hormones (like testosterone) change with age, which affects the size of the prostate.
In many individuals, the prostate grows large enough to squeeze the urethra—a tube that
passes through the prostate. The urethra allows urine to flow out of the bladder. This squeezing
can narrow the urethra, which slows down or stops the flow of urine when you try to pee.
Although prostate cancer usually doesn’t cause any symptoms, it also can slow the flow of
urine if it grows large enough. That’s why it’s important to get these problems checked out.

a key part of this system. Lymph nodes are
small, disease-fighting clusters that filter the
lymph fluid to remove germs. Lymph vessels
and nodes are found everywhere in the body.

Simply put, prostate cancer can be grouped
into early-stage cancer or advanced-stage
cancer.

A book about advanced prostate cancer,
NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Prostate
Cancer, Advanced Stage, can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines.

Early stage

Early-stage prostate cancer has not spread
beyond the prostate. Prostate cancer usually
grows slowly and stays in the prostate. Cancer
that is contained entirely within the prostate is
called localized prostate cancer.
This book is all about early-stage (localized)
prostate cancer.

Advanced stage

Advanced stage means that the cancer has
spread beyond the prostate to other areas in
the body. This spreading is called metastasis
or metastatic cancer. Prostate cancer can
metastasize to the bones, lymph nodes, liver,
lungs, and other organs.


Cancer that has spread from the prostate
gland to nearby lymph nodes, but no
farther, is called regional metastatic
prostate cancer.



Cancer that has spread beyond the
prostate and the regional lymph nodes is
called distant metastatic prostate cancer.

Cancer cells can use the bloodstream like a
highway to travel to distant areas in the body.
Cancer cells can also spread through the
lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is
a network of organs and vessels that fights
infections and circulates a clear fluid called
lymph throughout the body. Lymph nodes are

Where does the prostate fit in?
The prostate is located deep inside the lower body. It makes semen and is important for
sexual reproduction.
Prostate: A gland in the male reproductive system. A gland is an organ that makes fluids
or chemicals the body needs. The prostate gland makes a liquid that nourishes and helps
transmit semen.
Semen: A fluid made up of liquids from the prostate and the seminal vesicles as well as
sperm from the testicles. During ejaculation, semen is released from the body through the
urethra and out through the penis.
Urethra: A tube that carries urine from the bladder and out of the body. The prostate wraps
around the urethra just beneath the bladder.
Seminal vesicles: Two glands that make another part of the fluid that becomes semen. The
seminal vesicles are located above the prostate and behind the bladder.
Bladder: An organ that holds urine.

What are symptoms of prostate cancer?

What are symptoms of prostate
cancer?
A symptom is a feeling or problem that can
indicate a disease or condition. Prostate
cancer often grows slowly and shows no
symptoms for a long time. But you don’t have
to have symptoms to have prostate cancer.
This is especially true in the early stages of the
disease. Even advanced prostate cancer may
have few or mild symptoms. Some symptoms
that may occur include:


Urinating (peeing) frequently, especially at
night



Weak or intermittent urine stream



Trouble urinating or straining to urinate



Trouble holding in urine



Feeling like your bladder hasn’t fully
emptied



Blood in the urine or semen



Erectile dysfunction (difficulty getting an
erection)



Dull pain in the groin or pelvis



Burning or pain while urinating



Unexplained weight loss



Bone, hip, or back pain

Prostate cancer has
one of the highest
survival rates of
any cancer when
found early.

It’s important to know that prostate cancer has
many of the same symptoms as a condition
called enlarged prostate (also called benign
prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH). It’s difficult to
tell the difference between the two conditions
based on symptoms alone, and BPH is much
more common than prostate cancer. Be sure to
tell your doctor about any symptoms you have,
because you may need specific testing.

Can prostate cancer be cured?

Key points

Early-stage prostate cancer is highly
treatable and often curable. The earlier that
prostate cancer is diagnosed and treated,
the more likely that a patient will live without
cancer. The majority of people with early-stage
disease are able to live without cancer for
many years, usually the rest of their lives.
Treatments for early-stage prostate cancer
include surgery, radiation, and hormone
therapy, among others.
However, not everyone with prostate cancer
needs to be treated. Many patients with earlystage prostate cancer can be managed with
active surveillance. During active surveillance,
you’ll have regular tests to keep an eye on
your cancer. But you won’t have treatment
unless the cancer grows or changes in a
way that requires treatment. The goal of
active surveillance is to avoid the potential
side effects of treatment, with the option for
treatment in the future if you need it.
Advanced-stage prostate cancer isn’t
curable, but treatment can slow down its
growth and reduce symptoms. Treatment for
advanced-stage prostate cancer includes
surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and
hormone therapy. Many males with advancedstage prostate cancer continue to live their
lives with the cancer until they die from
something else. Early detection and treatment
can greatly reduce the chances of getting
advanced-stage prostate cancer.
Something to remember: When found early,
prostate cancer has one of the highest survival
rates of any cancer.

Prostate cancer tests

Screening tests

Testing is necessary to find out if you
have prostate cancer. If you do have
prostate cancer, testing can show
whether it’s early-stage or advancedstage cancer. Testing can also help your
doctors plan how to treat it.

Tips for testing
Results from blood tests, imaging studies,
and biopsies will be used to determine
your treatment plan. It’s important you
understand what these tests mean. Ask
questions and keep copies of your test
results. Online patient portals are a handy
way to access your test results.

Doctors use a variety of tests to find out if
you have prostate cancer and determine how
advanced the cancer is. Tests are used to plan
treatment and check how well treatment is
working. This chapter will help you know what
tests you may have and what to expect during
testing. Bring someone with you to listen, ask
questions, and write down the answers.

Remember these tips for testing:
•

Bring someone with you to doctor visits,
if possible.

•

Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.

•

Get copies of blood tests, imaging
results, and reports about the specific
type of cancer you have.

A screening test looks for disease before you
have any symptoms. The goal of screening is
to detect disease early when there’s a better
chance of stopping it.

•

Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on
your computer.

Screening tests aren’t diagnostic, which means
they can’t tell you for sure whether or not you
actually have the disease. Rather, screening
tests indicate that you may need a diagnostic
test.

•

Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add
it to your phone. Hang the list on
your refrigerator or keep it in a place
where someone can access it in an
emergency. Keep your primary care
physician informed of any changes.

Testing begins with screening tests, followed
by tests of your general health, and then
diagnostic tests, if needed. Not every person
with prostate cancer will receive every test
listed here.

Screening tests

The two screening tests for prostate cancer
are a digital rectal exam and a prostatespecific antigen (PSA) test.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2022

2

Prostate cancer tests

Screening tests

Digital rectal exam

PSA test

Don’t be fooled by the name—no high-tech
electronics are used in a digital rectal exam.
For this test, the word “digital” means “finger.”
To put it bluntly, the doctor will stick a finger up
your butt (rectum) to check your prostate. The
doctor will wear gloves and use a lubricant to
make it easier.

This test measures the amount of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) in your blood. PSA is a
protein made inside the prostate. Its job is to
help semen transport sperm.
Both normal prostate cells and prostate cancer
cells make PSA. If there’s something wrong
with the prostate—like prostate cancer—these
cells may make more PSA. An unusually high
amount of PSA in the blood may be a sign of
prostate cancer.

A digital rectal exam (also called a prostate
exam) may sound like a crude and unpleasant
form of testing. But it’s the simplest and most
direct way for the doctor to feel the size and
texture of your prostate. If the doctor finds an
irregular or hardened part of the prostate, it
could be a sign of a tumor.

However, other conditions—such as an
enlarged prostate or a urinary tract infection—
can also cause high levels of PSA. This
means that a PSA test by itself can’t provide a
diagnosis of prostate cancer. That’s why a PSA
test is often paired with a digital rectal exam or
imaging, or both, to decide whether you need
a biopsy.

Not every doctor will require you to have a
digital rectal exam. This decision depends on
a number of considerations. The digital rectal
exam is usually paired with a PSA test and
other factors—your age, race, family history,
and more—to determine whether you need
further testing, such as imaging or a biopsy.

If a person has a high PSA level but no other
symptoms of prostate cancer, a second PSA

procedure in which your
doctor will insert a finger
into your rectum to feel your
prostate. An irregular or

test may be performed. This is done to doublecheck the result before undergoing additional
testing.

For a blood test, a needle is inserted into
a vein in your arm to remove a sample of
blood. The sample is examined in a lab where
cells, proteins, and other components in the
blood are tested for signs of disease or other
conditions.

General health tests
Health history

Sometimes, men with a higher PSA level have
additional blood or urine testing. These tests,
sometimes referred to as biomarker tests,
can be used in addition to PSA to help decide
whether a biopsy is needed. Biomarker tests
such as PHI, SelectMDx, 4Kscore, MPS,
IsoPSA, and ExoDx are options to consider for
those with prostate cancer.

Your doctors need to have all of your health
information. They’ll ask you about any health
problems and treatments you’ve had in your
life. Be prepared to talk about any illness or
injury you’ve had and when it happened.
Bring a list of old and new medicines and any
over-the-counter medicines, herbals (such as
saw palmetto), or supplements you take. Tell
your doctor about any symptoms you have.

Diagnostic tests

Family history

If the digital rectal exam, PSA test, and other
factors (like family history, race, or age)
suggest you have prostate cancer, you’ll be
offered diagnostic testing. Talk with your doctor
about whether a biopsy or imaging should be
the next test you take.

Some cancers and other diseases can run in
families. Your doctor will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history.
It’s important to ask members from both your
mother’s and father’s side of the family about
all cancers, not just prostate cancer. Ask family
members about other health issues like heart
disease and diabetes, at what age they were
diagnosed, and if anyone died from cancer.
Share this information and any changes to
your family history with your doctor.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2022

Sometimes prostate cancer is found without
even looking for it. It might be discovered by
chance during a biopsy or surgery for another
health issue. This is called an incidental
finding.

Imaging tests

beyond the prostate), then you may not need
imaging tests at this time.

An imaging test takes pictures (images) of the
insides of your body. The images can reveal
cancer, including its size, location, and other
features such as the size of the prostate itself.
The images may show where the cancer
started (primary tumor) and whether the
cancer has spread (metastasized). Imaging
is also used after cancer treatment to see
how well it worked and to check if the cancer
comes back.

On the other hand, if your test results suggest
a high risk—or even a moderate risk—for the
cancer to spread, your doctor may recommend
one or more of the following imaging tests to
look for cancer growth:
CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. CT takes
many x-rays of the same body part from
different angles. The computer combines all
the x-ray pictures to make a single detailed
image.

Imaging can come before, during, or after a
biopsy.


Before – Imaging may be ordered
beforehand to find out if a biopsy is truly
necessary.



During – Imaging is used during a biopsy
to guide the removal of tissue samples.



After – Imaging may come after a biopsy
to see the size and location of the cancer,
which helps to plan treatment.

A CT scan of your abdomen and/or pelvis may
be used to look for cancer that has spread
beyond the prostate. CT scans are good at
seeing lymph nodes and the area around the
prostate.
A CT scanner is a large machine that has a
tunnel in the middle. During the test, you’ll
lie on a table that moves slowly through the
tunnel. Pillows or straps may be used to help
keep you still during the test. Tell your team if
you get nervous in small spaces. You may be
given a sedative (medicine) to help you relax.

Imaging methods for detecting prostate
cancer include ultrasound, MRI, CT, PET, or a
combination of these.
After your scan, your images will be studied by
a radiologist. A radiologist is a doctor who’s an
expert in reading imaging tests. The radiologist
will send the results to your doctor. This
information helps your doctor plan the next
steps of your care. Your doctor will discuss the
results with you. Be sure to ask any questions
you may have.

You may also be given contrast (sometimes
called contrast dye) before the CT scan.
Contrast is used to make blood vessels,
organs, and other tissues stand out more
clearly in the images. Contrast is injected into
the bloodstream and flushed out in urine.

Imaging may not be needed for early-stage
prostate cancer. If your PSA, digital rectal
exam, and biopsy results indicate that your risk
is low for the cancer to metastasize (spread

For the scan, you’ll be alone but a technician
will operate the machine in a nearby room. The

have certain treatment, such as active
surveillance.

As the machine takes pictures, you may hear
buzzing, clicking, or whirring sounds. A CT
scan is done in about 30 seconds, but the
entire process takes 20 to 30 minutes.

PET scan
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
highlights cells in your body that may be
cancerous. A PET scan can show even small
amounts of cancer. It’s used after you’ve been
diagnosed to determine the extent of your
cancer or to see if it has metastasized. PET
imaging can also show how well treatment is
working.

MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. Like a
CT scan, an MRI may use contrast to make
the images clearer. Also like a CT scan, the
MRI scanner is a large machine with a tunnel
in the middle. It also makes a lot of noise.
Unlike a CT scan, MRI doesn’t use radiation
(x-rays).

A PET scan requires injecting a radioactive
substance called a tracer into your
bloodstream. It takes about an hour for the
tracer to circulate throughout your body. The
tracer targets your cancer cells, which show
up as bright spots on the scan. Afterward, the
radiotracer is passed out of your body in your
urine.

An MRI is used to get a more detailed view of
the cancer within the prostate. It’s also used
to see if cancer has spread to nearby lymph
nodes or to the bones in your pelvis.

Like a CT and MRI, a PET scanner is a large,
donut-shaped machine with a tunnel in the
middle. A PET scan appointment can take 1 to
2 hours, including about 30 minutes of actual
scanning time.

Because an MRI uses magnets, don’t bring
any metal objects (jewelry, cell phone,
wristwatch, belts with metal buckles) into the
imaging room.




mpMRI

PSMA-PET imaging is a special kind of
PET imaging that locates a protein called
prostate-specific membrane antigen
(PSMA) on the surface of prostate cancer
cells. Prostate cancer cells make a lot of
PSMA, so doctors developed tracers that
target this specific protein.

A multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is a
special type of MRI scan. In an mpMRI,
multiple scans are performed without
contrast followed by another MRI with
contrast.
You might have more than one mpMRI
during the course of treatment. An
mpMRI might be done to learn more
about your prostate cancer or to look for
bleeding after a biopsy. An mpMRI might
help detect certain types of tumors. It
also might help determine if you should

PSMA-PET is especially useful for
detecting cancer that has spread to

to farther areas. PSMA-PET is used to
see smaller metastases. It’s also used to

treatment, or other health problems.

Because PET uses a different imaging
method, it’s often combined with other
types of imaging, such as CT or MRI, to
provide an even more detailed image.
These combined methods are called PET/
CT or PET/MRI scans.

Biopsy

Bone scan
A bone scan can detect whether cancer has
spread to your bones. A bone scan may be
used if you have bone pain, have a high risk
for bone metastases, or have changes in
certain test results. Bone scans may also be
used to monitor treatment.

A biopsy is a procedure that removes a small
piece of tissue or cells from your body. The
samples are tested in a laboratory to find
cancer. A biopsy is the only test that can
confirm (diagnose) prostate cancer.
A biopsy is an invasive test, which means that
it goes into (invades) your body. All invasive

Prostate cancer tests

Diagnostic tests
If the pathologist finds cancer cells in the
samples, further testing can identify your
cancer risk. More tests may indicate that
the cancer will grow and spread quickly, for
example. Or the results may suggest that the
cancer will grow very slowly and not spread
outside of the prostate at all. This information
helps plan the best treatment for your type of
cancer.

tests have some risk. The risks for a prostate
biopsy include infection, bleeding, and pain.
Doctors use invasive tests only when needed.
You and your doctors will decide when, or if,
you need a biopsy.
The most common biopsy for prostate cancer
is a core needle biopsy. This procedure is
usually performed by a urologist using an
ultrasound probe inserted in the rectum to
see the prostate. A urologist is a doctor who’s
an expert in treating diseases of the urinary
system and the male reproductive organs.

Genetic tests

A genetic test is used to find abnormal
changes (mutations) in your genes. Genes
are small segments of DNA inside every cell.
Genes provide the instructions to tell the cell
how to make proteins, which are the building
blocks of tissues.

For this procedure, you’ll lie on a table on
your side with your knees bent. Once the
lubricated probe is inserted into your rectum, it
will release high-energy sound waves that will
bounce off of internal tissues. A computer will
convert these sound waves into a sonogram,
which shows a video image of the prostate.

Once in a while, a gene will have or develop
an abnormal change (mutation). A mutation is
when something is different in your genes than
in most other people's genes. Sometimes an
abnormal change can cause a gene to make
the wrong type of protein or make no protein at
all. This abnormality could affect the cell, which
may in turn cause a disease—such as cancer.

The urologist will then insert a hollow needle
into the prostate gland using the ultrasound
image to guide it. The needle will be inserted
either through the rectum or through the
perineum (the skin between the anus and
scrotum). When the doctor removes the
needle, it will pull out a small sample of
prostate tissue called a core.

Mutations can be passed down in families,
in which case they occur in every cell in your
body. Or, mutations can occur spontaneously
in just some of your cells, such as in cancer
cells. In other words, they may be present
before you’re born (called an inherited or
germline mutation) or occur on their own later
in life (called an acquired or somatic mutation).

Your doctor will take 12 or more core samples
from different parts of the prostate. Sometimes
these will be removed from a specific area in
the prostate based on the findings of an MRI.
Your biopsy samples will then be sent to a
lab for testing. At the lab, a specialist called
a pathologist will examine the samples under
a microscope. A pathologist is a doctor who’s
an expert at examining cells and tissue to find
disease.

Prostate cancer tests

Diagnostic tests
Germline testing is recommended for those
with prostate cancer and any of the following:

The two basic types of genetic tests used for
prostate cancer care are germline testing and
molecular biomarker testing:
Germline testing
Sometimes, mutations in genes inherited from
your parents can increase the risk of different
cancers. You can pass these genes on to your
children. Other family members might also
carry these mutations. If you have a family
history of cancer or other features, your doctor
might suggest genetic testing to find out if you
have an inherited cancer risk.

cancer, ovarian cancer, intestinal cancer,
and certain other cancers

metastatic prostate cancer regardless of
family history





Having any other cancer

Talk to your medical providers and/or a genetic
counselor about your family history of cancer.

The goal of this type of genetic testing is to
look for germline (inherited) mutations that
occur in every cell in your body. Genetic
germline testing is done using a sample of
your blood, urine, or saliva.

Molecular biomarker testing
In biomarker testing, a sample from your
biopsy is tested to look at its molecular
components. This information is used to help
choose the best treatment for you. Biomarker
testing can be considered for those with
localized, regional, or metastatic prostate
cancer. Biomarker testing is sometimes called
gene profiling or molecular tumor testing.

For prostate cancer, germline testing looks for
mutations in these genes: BRCA1, BRCA2,
ATM, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2,
PMS2, and others. Some mutations can put
you at risk for more than one type of cancer.
Germline mutations in genes like BRCA1 or
BRCA2 are also related to breast, ovarian,
and pancreatic cancer. Germline mutations in
MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 are related
to colorectal and uterine cancers in addition to
prostate cancer.

The main reason to have a molecular
biomarker test is to help assess whether you
have lower or higher risk prostate cancer.
If you have lower risk cancer, you may be
able to avoid or delay treatment such as
surgery or radiation therapy, which means
you’d also avoid or delay any treatmentrelated complications and side effects. On
the other hand, a molecular biomarker test
can flag those who have higher risk prostate
cancer, which may give them a head start on
treatment.

If a germline mutation is suspected based on
your family’s or your own health history, you
should seek genetic counseling. A genetic
counselor is an expert who has special training
in genetic diseases and can help you decide
whether you would like to undergo germline
testing. A genetic counselor will also help you
interpret the results of these tests.

Clinical characteristics of risk

Digital rectal exam

It’s important to know the risk of your
cancer getting worse. Doctors look at
several key characteristics to find out
your risk group. This chapter explains
each of these characteristics.

Let’s take a look at the following tests to see
how they contribute to each risk group:

Digital rectal exam

Early-stage prostate cancer hasn’t spread
outside the prostate itself. But what are the
chances that it could? What are the chances
that it might grow or spread after treatment?

A digital rectal exam is used to screen for
cancer, rate the tumor size, and assess how
your cancer is responding to treatment. For this
test, your doctor will insert a lubricated, gloved
finger into your rectum. Your doctor will feel
your prostate for abnormal size or hardness,
either of which may be a sign of a tumor.

Both doctors and patients want to know the risk
for the cancer to spread. So doctors look at the
clinical characteristics of your cancer, such as
your PSA level, biopsy results, and other test
results (which we’ll talk about in this chapter).
From this information, doctors can classify your
disease into one of 5 different risk groups:

Not all parts of the prostate can be felt during
this exam, though. So other tests, like PSA
level and imaging, are used to get a more
complete picture of your prostate health.

1. Very low risk
2. Low risk
3. Intermediate risk

Diagnosis vs. prognosis

4. High risk
5. Very high risk

What’s the difference between your
diagnosis and your prognosis? These
two words sound alike but they’re very
different.

Why do you need to know your risk group?
Because your prognosis is based on your risk
group. A prognosis predicts the likely course and
outcome of a disease. Your prognosis guides
your treatment options. For example, patients
with lower risk generally get minimal treatment
or no treatment at all. Patients with higher risk
usually get more aggressive treatment.

Diagnosis means identifying an illness
based on tests. Your diagnosis names
what illness you have.

Prognosis is the likely course and

But before we get into treatment, let’s
talk about the clinical characteristics that
make up each of the 5 risk groups. These
characteristics come from the results of tests
described in the previous chapter plus tests

outcome of a disease based on tests
and your response to treatment. Your
prognosis predicts how your illness will
turn out.

3

Clinical characteristics of risk

PSA

PSA

Other factors

Several other factors can affect PSA level, too.

A simple blood test will tell you how much
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is in your
bloodstream. PSA level (also called total PSA)
is measured in nanograms of PSA per milliliter
(ng/mL) of blood. A high amount of PSA in
the blood may be a sign of prostate cancer.
However, high PSA levels can vary by age and
other factors.



The larger the prostate, the more PSA
it can make. In addition to cancer, other
health issues can also cause an enlarged
prostate.



Some medicines, herbals, and
supplements can also affect PSA level.



PSA level rises after a biopsy of the
prostate.



PSA increases after ejaculations and
vigorous exercise (like running or
bicycling). Your doctor may recommend
avoiding sex and exercise for 2 or 3 days
before a PSA test. This respite allows
PSA to return to its usual level.

Age

PSA level tends to increase with age. For
males in their 40s, a PSA level above
2.5 ng/mL is very suspicious for disease. For
males in their 60s, 4.5 ng/mL or higher is
suspicious. A PSA level of 10 ng/mL or higher
is a danger sign at any age. See Guide 1.

PSA level doesn’t tell the whole story, though.
There are other ways that PSA can be
interpreted, such as PSA density.

Race

Black males tend to have higher PSA levels
than White males—about 1 point higher on
average among males of the same age.
Researchers don’t know the reason for this
difference, but they’re investigating it.

PSA density

Males with larger prostates tend to have higher
PSA levels. But that doesn’t mean they have a
greater likelihood for prostate cancer. To adjust
for this, doctors can calculate the PSA density.

Guide 1
PSA increases with age

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2022

PSA density is the amount of PSA compared
to the size of the prostate. PSA density is
calculated by dividing a patient’s PSA level
by his prostate size. The size of the prostate
is measured by transrectal ultrasound or MRI
scan. A higher PSA density (above 0.15 ng/
mL2, for example) indicates a greater likelihood
of cancer. PSA density also accounts for males
with small and very small prostates, who could
have prostate cancer even with low PSAs.

Prostate biopsy

Prostate biopsy

two (called a confirmatory biopsy) to see if the
results of both biopsies are the same.

A biopsy removes a sample of tissue that’s
tested for cancer. Rising PSA levels and an
abnormal digital rectal exam are signs of
possible prostate cancer. However, the only
way to know for sure if you have prostate
cancer is to remove tissue from your body and
test it for cancer cells.

There are two surgical methods for prostate
cancer biopsies: transrectal and transperineal.

Transrectal biopsy

A transrectal biopsy is the most common
type of prostate biopsy. A sample of tissue is
removed by going into the rectum (transrectal)
and, from there, into the prostate.

For a prostate biopsy, a sample of tissue is
removed using a hollow needle. You may
need to stop taking some medicines, such as
aspirin or blood thinners, a week before the
procedure.

This can be done in the urologist’s office.
You’ll be awake for the procedure but receive
anesthesia to prevent any pain. You’ll lie on
your side with your knees curled up. A probe
will be inserted into your rectum. The probe
has a spring-loaded hollow needle. Your
doctor will trigger the needle to go through the

It’s common for patients to have more than one
biopsy. You’ll have one biopsy to determine
your diagnosis and another biopsy in a year or

Prostate biopsy
A biopsy removes a sample of
tissue that is tested for cancer.
A biopsy is the only way to
be certain that someone has
cancer. This is a transperineal
biopsy, in which a needle is
inserted through the perineum
and into the prostate. An
ultrasound probe, which goes
into the rectum, helps the
doctor guide the needle into the
prostate.

Prostate biopsy
Transperineal biopsy

rectal wall and into your prostate. The needle
will remove tissue samples—called cores—
about the length of a dime and the width of a
toothpick.

For a transperineal biopsy, a needle is inserted
into the prostate through the perineum. The
perineum is the area in the crotch between the
testicles and the anus.

At least 12 or more core samples are taken
from different parts of the prostate. Checking
different areas provides a more complete
evaluation of cancer throughout the gland.

For this biopsy, you’ll lie on your back with your
legs raised or you’ll lie on your side with your
knees curled up. Depending on the center,
you’ll be given general anesthesia that will
put you to sleep for the procedure or you’ll
be awake for the procedure and have local
anesthesia to numb your genital and prostate
area.

To ensure the best samples are removed,
imaging methods—ultrasound, MRI, or
sometimes both—are used to view the
prostate gland and guide the needle.

After cleansing the perineum, the doctor will
insert a long biopsy needle through the skin
and into the prostate to draw out samples of
tissue. The doctor may make multiple needle
punctures in the perineum to remove multiple
core samples. Or the doctor may use a
technique that removes multiple samples but
requires only a few punctures through the skin.

Transrectal biopsies aren’t perfect tests.
They sometimes miss cancer sites in the
prostate. They can also cause complications.
A complication is an unwanted and unplanned
result from an operation. Complications of a
transrectal biopsy include bleeding from the
rectum or blood in the urine, stool, or semen.
This usually goes away after a few days or,
with semen, after a few weeks.

Ultrasound, MRI, or a combination of both
imaging methods are used to guide this
procedure. The ultrasound or MRI probe
must be inserted into the rectum to scan the
prostate.

Fever is a sign of a more serious complication,
and it’s caused by an infection. To prevent
this, you’ll be given an antibiotic medicine to
take the day of the biopsy and for a few days
after it. Even with antibiotics, infection is still a
serious risk with transrectal biopsy. Difficulty
peeing is another uncommon but potentially
serious complication. Speak to your doctor if
you have either of these problems.

The transperineal procedure takes about 20 to
40 minutes.

A transrectal biopsy, including preparation and
recovery, may take several hours, though the
procedure itself takes only about 20 minutes.

Pathology report

Your biopsy samples will be sent to a lab
where a pathologist will examine them under
a microscope and test them for cancer. The
pathologist will find out how many of the core
samples contain cancer and will also measure
the percentage of cancer in each core. With
this information, the pathologist can estimate
the amount of cancer in the prostate and can
sometimes tell whether the cancer has spread
outside of the prostate. Also, by knowing
where each core sample was taken, the
pathologist can figure out whether the cancer
is concentrated in a certain section of the
prostate.

Gleason score
After studying your biopsy sample under

Gleason score. A Gleason score represents
how much your biopsy sample looks like
normal prostate tissue. It also describes how
aggressive your prostate cancer is—how
quickly it will grow and whether it will spread.
A Gleason score is another factor that doctors
use to determine risk and plan treatment.

Take our survey

For a Gleason score, the pathologist assigns
a number, ranging from 3 to 5, based on the
“pattern” of cancer cells in the biopsy sample.
Cancer with a cell pattern that looks more like
normal and healthy cells has a lower number.
Cancer with a cell pattern that looks more
abnormal has a higher number.

Clinical characteristics of risk

Gleason score
Most prostate cancers have a Gleason score
between 6 and 10. A Gleason score of 6 is
low-grade cancer, 7 is intermediate-grade,
and 8 to 10 is high-grade. A higher Gleason
score means the cancer is more likely to grow
and spread quickly than a cancer with a lower
Gleason score.

Prostate cancers often contain more than one
pattern of cancer cells. To account for this, a
Gleason score is made up of two numbers.
The pathologist gives one number to the
pattern of cancer cells that take up the largest
area in the tumor. The second number is given
to the cell pattern that accounts for the secondlargest area.

To double-check your Gleason score, you can
ask for a second pathologist to review your
biopsy.

Add these two numbers together and you get a
Gleason score. For example:
pattern 3 + pattern 4 = Gleason score of 7

Low-grade cancer is less aggressive and
likely to grow and spread very slowly. If the
cancer is small, many years may pass before
it becomes a problem. Low-grade cancer may
never need treatment.

Intermediate-grade cancer is moderately
aggressive and likely to grow and spread at
a modest pace. If the cancer is small, several
years may pass before it becomes a problem.
To prevent problems, treatment may be
needed.

High-grade cancer is very aggressive and
likely to grow and spread quickly. If the cancer
is small, a few years may pass before the
cancer becomes a life-threatening problem. To
prevent problems, treatment is needed now.

Clinical characteristics of risk

Grade groups | Tumor stage

Grade groups

Tumor stage

Gleason scores can be organized into Grade
Groups to make them simpler to understand.
A Gleason score ranges from 6 to 10, where
6 is the lowest score. This can be confusing
because 6 seems like it would be a medium
score, not a low score. There are five Grade
Groups, numbered 1 to 5. The higher the
Grade Group, the more aggressive the cancer.
A Gleason score 6 cancer is assigned Grade
Group 1 to show that it is the lowest score.

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to “stage” prostate cancer. Staging is a
way to describe how much cancer is in your
body and how far it has spread. Knowing your
stage is important for predicting the course of
your disease and for making a treatment plan.
In this system, the letters T, N, and M stand for
different areas of cancer growth:

The Grade Group system also takes into
account that Grade Group 2 and Grade
Group 3 both have a Gleason score of 7. The
difference is the cancer in Grade Group 3 is
more serious. Why? Because the first number
of the Gleason score in Grade Group 3 (4+3)
is higher than the first number in Grade Group
2 (3+4). Remember, the first number is given
to the cancer pattern that makes up the largest
area of the tumor. See Guide 2.



T (tumor) - Describes the size of the
main (primary) tumor and if it has grown
outside the prostate



N (node) – Identifies whether cancer has
spread to nearby lymph nodes



M (metastasis) – Indicates if cancer
has spread to distant parts of the body
(metastasized)

Based on test results, your doctor will assign a
number to each letter. The higher the number,
the larger the tumor or the more the cancer
has spread. These scores are combined to
assign a stage to the cancer.
Cancer staging is often done twice. The first
time is before any treatment. The second time
is after (or during) treatment to see how well
the treatment has worked.

Clinical characteristics of risk

Tumor stage

Know the (TNM) score
Tumors come in all shapes and sizes. This makes
it tough to be able to compare one tumor to
another. So cancer experts created a “score” that
can describe any tumor. Each letter is matched
with a number that explains the extent of the
cancer.

T = Tumor
T stands for tumor, and the numbers 0 through 4
refer to its size and growth:
•

T0 means that no tumor can be detected.

•

T1 tumors can’t be felt during a digital rectal
exam and aren’t found on imaging tests,
although a biopsy shows cancer is present.

•

•

•

T2 tumors can be felt during a digital rectal
exam. They also may be seen on an imaging
test. T2 tumors are found only in the prostate
gland.
T3 tumors have broken through the outside
layer of the prostate gland. They may reach
the connective tissue around the prostate or
the neck of the bladder.
T4 tumors have grown outside the prostate

into nearby structures such as the bladder,
rectum, pelvic muscles, or pelvic wall.

N = Node
N is for node, as in lymph node. There are
hundreds of lymph nodes throughout your body.
They work as filters to help fight infection and
remove harmful substances. The number 0 or
1 after the letter N tells whether the cancer has
or hasn’t spread to the lymph nodes near the
prostate:
•

N0 means cancer hasn’t spread to any lymph
nodes.

•

N1 means cancer has spread to lymph nodes
near the prostate (regional lymph nodes).

M = Metastasis
When prostate cancer metastasizes, it tends to
spread to the bones, liver, lungs, distant lymph
nodes, and other organs:
•

M0 means the cancer hasn’t spread to distant
parts of the body.

•

M1 metastasis has spread to distant parts of
the body.

How to read a TNM score
Let’s say your prostate cancer is given a TNM
score of T2, N0, M0. This score means that the
tumor is big enough to be felt during a digital
rectal exam (T2), but it hasn’t spread outside
the prostate gland to nearby lymph nodes (N0)
or to distant parts of the body (M0).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2022

Why know your TNM score? For one, it lets
you know the extent of your cancer. It also
helps characterize your risk group. Your risk
group suggests the most appropriate treatment
for you.

Risk assessment

Risk groups

Risk groups

A risk assessment estimates the
chances of future problems or
difficulties. In the case of prostate
cancer, a risk assessment helps to plan
the best treatment for you.

Doctors use risk groups to help choose
treatment options and to predict the likelihood
that the cancer will recur after initial treatment.
As you read in Chapter 3, results from several
different tests are put together to determine
each risk group:

After being told you have cancer, your next
thought may be, “How soon can I start
treatment to get rid of it?” The fact is, a lot
of patients with prostate cancer don’t need
treatment right away. Many never need
treatment.
So who needs treatment and who doesn’t?
Figuring out when to be treated or which
treatment to use requires an assessment
of your risks. A risk assessment involves
identifying potential problems and then
considering what would happen if those
problems occurred. In the case of prostate
cancer, a risk assessment considers how likely
the cancer is to:


Remain within the prostate



Spread to nearby lymph nodes



Come back after treatment (recurrence)

Be controlled with another treatment

Life expectancy

Additional tests

Once your doctor determines your risk group,
you may need some additional tests before
you can be treated, particularly if you’re in a
higher risk category. If you didn’t have an MRI
or mpMRI earlier, you’ll likely have one at this
point. Other tests that may be done—or redone—to confirm your diagnosis and plan your
treatment include:

Life expectancy is the average lifespan of a
person. It’s measured in years. An estimate
of your life expectancy is an important factor
in deciding which tests and treatments you’ll
need.
It’s important to be aware that life expectancy
is only an estimate based on large numbers
of people. That means life expectancy can
be applied to a big population or a broad age
range, but it’s not as easy to make a precise
estimate of the lifespan of an individual patient.

Risk assessment

Nomograms

Guide 4
T Guide
In Guide 3, the TNM score includes letters after the tumor stage. These letters give more information
about the amount of cancer and its location in the prostate.
T1a – Cancer found in 5 percent (5%) or less of the removed tissue.

T1

T1b – Cancer found in more than 5 percent (5%) of the removed tissue.
T1c – Cancer found in one or both sides of the prostate.
T2a – Cancer is found in half or less than half of one side of the prostate.

T2

T2b – Cancer is found in more than half of one side of the prostate, but it isn't in both sides.
T2c – Cancer has grown into both sides of the prostate.

T3

T3a – Cancer has grown outside the prostate, but not into the seminal vesicle(s).
T3b – Cancer has grown outside the prostate and into the seminal vesicle(s).

Nomograms

Sometimes, patients in certain risk groups
should wait until symptoms appear before
having tests or starting treatment. Prostate
cancer often grows slowly. There may be no
benefit to having additional tests or undergoing
treatment if you don’t have any symptoms or
if you have other more life-threatening health
conditions.

A nomogram predicts the course your cancer
will take (your prognosis). A nomogram uses
math to compare you and your prostate cancer
to hundreds or thousands of other patients
who have been treated for prostate cancer.
To use a nomogram, your doctor will input
information about you and the characteristics
of your cancer—your age, PSA level, Gleason
score, or other details—and the nomogram will
calculate the likely result of a certain treatment
or outcome.

If you don’t have any symptoms, are expected
to live 10 years or less, and have very-lowrisk, low-risk, or intermediate-risk cancer, then
observation is usually recommended. This is
different than active surveillance, which usually
involves routine imaging and biopsies.

For comparison, risk groups are used to
consider the many treatment options for
prostate cancer while nomograms can provide
information that is more specific to you. Both
are used, along with other risk assessment
tools, to plan treatment.

We’ll talk more about life expectancy and how
it impacts treatment options in Chapter 6.

Molecular tumor tests | Key points

Molecular tumor tests

Key points

Molecules are very tiny particles found in the
cells of your body. Special tests are now used
to measure certain molecules and biomarkers.
A biomarker is something found in your body
that can be measured to assess your health.
One type of cancer biomarker is a molecule
released by a tumor.



A risk assessment identifies potential
problems and then considers what would
happen if those problems occurred.



A risk assessment consists of risk groups,
life expectancy, nomograms, and possibly
molecular tumor tests. A risk assessment
is used to plan treatment.

Molecular tests use samples of prostate or
lymph node tissue that was removed during
biopsy. Results from these and other tests
may help choose a treatment plan that’s right
for you. Another reason you might have a
molecular test is to see how well your body is
responding to prostate cancer treatment.



Doctors use risk groups to help choose
treatment options and to predict the
likelihood that cancer will recur after initial
treatment.



Results from several different tests are
put together to determine your risk group.



Life expectancy is the number of years
you will likely live. Life expectancy is used
to choose the best treatment for you.



Observation is recommended for those
with a life expectancy of 5 years or less.



A nomogram predicts the course your
cancer will take, called a prognosis.



An important feature of molecular tests is
that they can identify lower risk prostate
cancer that doesn’t need treatment right
away.

Importantly, molecular tests can identify
lower risk prostate cancer that doesn’t need
treatment right away. These patients can be
spared aggressive treatment along with its
complications and side effects.
A molecular tumor test is also known as a
molecular assay or analysis. A few of the more
common molecular tests for prostate cancer
are named Decipher, Oncotype DX, and
Prolaris.
If your doctor recommends molecular testing, it
would be in addition to standard tests such as
PSA, Gleason score, and imaging. If you have
any questions about why you’re having a test
or what it means, ask your care team.

Prostate cancer treatment

Treatment team

There’s more than one treatment for
prostate cancer. This chapter describes
treatment options and what to expect.
Discuss with your doctor which
treatment might be best for you.



A urologic oncologist is a surgeon who
specializes in diagnosing and treating
cancers of the urinary tract and the male
reproductive organs.



A radiation oncologist prescribes and
plans radiation therapy to treat cancer.



A medical oncologist treats cancer
using systemic therapies such as
hormone therapy and chemotherapy. A
medical oncologist will often coordinate
your care with other team members. If
not, ask who will coordinate your care.



Advanced practice providers are
an important part of any team. These
are registered nurse practitioners and
physician assistants who monitor your
health and provide care.



Residents and fellows are doctors who
are continuing their training, some to
become specialists in a certain field of
medicine.



Oncology nurses provide your handson care, like giving systemic therapy,
managing your care, answering
questions, and helping you cope with side
effects.



Nutritionists can provide guidance on
what foods or diet are most suitable for
your particular condition.



Psychologists and psychiatrists are
mental health experts who can help
manage issues such as depression,
anxiety, or other mental health conditions
that can affect how you feel.



Genetic counselors are experts who can
help interpret how your family history may
impact your treatment.

Treatment team
Treating prostate cancer takes a team
approach. Some members of your care
team will be with you throughout your cancer
treatment, while others will only be there for
parts of it. Your team should communicate and
work together to bring the best knowledge from
each specialty. Get to know your care team
and help them get to know you.
Depending on your diagnosis, your team may
include a dozen or more health care providers:






Your primary care doctor handles
medical care not related to your cancer.
Your primary doctor can help you express
your thoughts about treatments to your
cancer care team.
A pathologist interprets tests on cells,
tissues, and organs removed during a
biopsy or surgery.
A diagnostic radiologist reads the
results of x-rays and other imaging tests.



An anesthesiologist gives anesthesia,
a medicine so you don’t feel pain during
surgery or procedures.



A urologist is an expert in the male and
female urinary systems and the male
reproductive organs.

Prostate cancer treatment

Observation

Observation

TIP: It’s important to see both a
radiation oncologist and a urologist to
discuss the treatment approach that’s
right for you.

Observation involves monitoring your prostate
cancer and watching for symptoms. (You
may hear it called watch-and-wait or watchful
waiting.) If symptoms develop, treatment is
focused on palliative care or symptom relief
instead of trying to cure the cancer. Palliative
care treats the symptoms of cancer and the
side effects of cancer treatment. This allows
patients to maintain a good quality of life
without the burden of unnecessary treatment.

Keep a list of names and contact information
for each member of your team. This will make
it easier for you and anyone involved in your
care to know who to contact with questions or
concerns.

Observation often applies to older or frail
patients with shorter life expectancies. These
patients commonly have one or more other
illnesses or diseases that are more severe
than their prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer is usually a slow-growing
disease. It’s also a complex disease with
many treatment options. Treatments for early
prostate cancer include surgery, radiation
therapy, and hormone therapy to remove or
reduce the size of the tumor. Treatment can be
local, systemic, or a combination of both.


Local therapies target specific areas of
the body that contain cancer cells.



Systemic therapies attack cancer cells
throughout the body.

Observation is different from active
surveillance. Observation is a less aggressive
way to monitor prostate cancer. It doesn’t
require regular biopsies—just a PSA test and a
physical once or twice a year. By comparison,
active surveillance involves frequent testing to
see whether the cancer is progressing in order
to cure it before it can get worse.

Then again, your treatment plan may
include no direct therapy but instead include
observation or active surveillance:

Active surveillance
Active surveillance is a plan that closely
watches your condition, with treatment at the
ready if needed.
Because a small tumor can grow very slowly,
it’s possible to wait to treat prostate cancer
until the tumor grows larger. During this time,
you’ll have tests and biopsies on a regular
basis to look for changes in tumor growth. You
won’t receive any cancer treatment during

Prostate cancer treatment

Active surveillance
Other factors that you and your doctor should
consider:

active surveillance. But treatment will begin if
your cancer grows or spreads.
Why wait to be treated? Mainly because
surgery and other forms of treatment have
side effects. If you can delay treatment without
harm—or avoid it altogether—then you can
also delay or entirely avoid the side effects of
treatment.
Overall, active surveillance is the preferred
strategy for patients (particularly younger
patients) with lower-risk prostate cancer and a
longer life expectancy (10 or more years).

There are two types of treatment:

•

Systemic therapy works throughout
the body. Systemic therapy includes
hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and
other treatments designed to maintain
or improve your quality of life.

A big question about active surveillance: When
do you know to switch from surveillance to
treatment? There are a number of factors
but the most common one is that a patient’s
Grade Group in a later biopsy has increased
compared to a previous biopsy.

Local vs systemic therapy

Local therapy focuses on a certain
area of the body. In prostate cancer,
local treatments include surgery and
radiation therapy.

Your life expectancy

Regular tests during active surveillance
include:

To see if you’re a good candidate for active
surveillance, you may need a confirmatory
mpMRI with or without a confirmatory prostate
biopsy. Molecular tumor analysis can also be
considered in patients with very-low-, low-, and
favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer to
help decide if active surveillance is an option.

•



Other reasons for starting treatment may
include an increase in the size of the tumor
or a rise in PSA level. A patient’s feelings of
anxiety (due to living with untreated cancer)
can also be a valid reason to consider
treatment.

42

Prostate cancer treatment

Surgery

Surgery

Surgery can be used as the main (primary)
treatment. Or surgery may be only one part
of a treatment plan. The type of surgery you
receive depends on the size and location of
the tumor. It also depends on whether cancer
is found in any surrounding organs and
tissues.

Surgery is a procedure to remove cancer from
the body. The tumor will be removed along with
some normal-looking prostate tissue around its
edge called the surgical margin.




A positive margin (R1) is when cancer
cells are found along the edge of the
tissue that the surgeon removes.

Radical prostatectomy

Prostatectomy means removing the prostate
gland through surgery. A radical prostatectomy
removes not only the entire prostate but also
the surrounding tissue and seminal vesicles.
Pelvic lymph nodes may also be removed.

A negative margin (R0) is when no
cancer cells are found around the edge of
the tissue that the surgeon removes.

A negative margin is the better result because
it means that all of the tumor in that area has
likely been removed.

Open vs. minimally invasive prostatectomy
A prostatectomy is an operation that removes the whole prostate. Open surgery removes
the prostate through one large cut or incision. Minimally invasive surgery uses several small
incisions or cuts instead of one large cut.

Surgery
and the nearby tissues inside your body.
Other surgical tools are used to remove
the tumor.

A radical prostatectomy is often used when:


The tumor is found only in the prostate.



The tumor can be removed completely
with surgery.



You have a life expectancy of 10 or more
years.



You have no other serious health
conditions.

Either open surgery or minimally invasive
surgery can be used for a radical prostatectomy.
Patients who receive minimally invasive
surgery often have shorter hospital stays, less
blood loss, fewer surgical complications, and
faster recovery time. The major side effects
from robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy—
incontinence and erectile dysfunction—occur
about as often as they do with open surgery.

A radical prostatectomy is complex and
requires a great deal of skill. Surgeons who
are experienced in this type of surgery often
have better results.

Side effects of surgery
Radical prostatectomy frequently causes two
side effects:

There are two surgical methods for radical
prostatectomy:




Urinary incontinence. You’ll likely lose
the ability to hold your pee after a radical
prostatectomy. This is called urinary
incontinence and it’s usually temporary. Most
patients gradually recover control of their
bladder in a few weeks or months.

Open surgery removes the prostate
through one large cut or incision. The
large incision lets your doctor directly view
and access the tumor to remove it. When
the incision runs from your belly button
down to the base of your penis, it’s called
radical retropubic prostatectomy. When
the cut is made in the perineum (the area
between your scrotum and anus), it’s
called a radical perineal prostatectomy.

Immediately after the procedure, a catheter
will be inserted into your urethra to allow you
to empty your bladder and for your urethra to
heal. The catheter will stay in place for 1 to
2 weeks after surgery. You’ll be shown how
to care for it while at home. If the catheter is
removed too early, you may lose control of
your bladder or be unable to urinate due to
scar tissue.

Minimally invasive surgery has become
more common than open surgery.
Minimally invasive surgery uses several
small incisions or cuts instead of one
large cut. The surgeon uses robotic arms
to precisely insert small tools through
each incision to perform the surgery.
This is called robot-assisted radical
prostatectomy. One of the tools, called
an endoscope, has a light and a video
camera at the end. The camera gives the
surgeon a magnified view of your prostate

Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy

Erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction
means having difficulty or being unable to
have an erection of the penis. This happens a
lot after prostate surgery but it’s also usually
temporary. There’s a higher risk for erectile
dysfunction if:


You are older



You have erectile problems before
surgery



Your cavernous nerves are damaged or
removed during surgery

Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation
from x-rays, gamma rays, and other sources to
kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. It’s given in
regular doses over a certain period of time.
Radiation can be used instead of surgery to
cure cancer. Sometimes, radiation therapy is
given after surgery to help prevent your cancer
from coming back. Also, if your PSA begins to
rise after surgery, radiation therapy might be
recommended to try to kill any cancer cells that
could have been left behind. One advantage of
radiation therapy is that it’s less invasive than
surgery.

The cavernous nerves control the ability to
have erections. These nerves run alongside
the prostate. Doctors do their best to
avoid these nerves when performing a
prostatectomy, but damage to the nerves
during surgery is sometimes unavoidable.

There are two main types of radiation
treatment:

EBRT

Removing your prostate and seminal vesicles
will cause you to have dry orgasms. This
means there will be no semen and you’ll be
unable to have children (infertile). You may
want to look into sperm banking before the
surgery if you’re thinking of having children.

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s). The radiation beam focuses
directly on the cancer while trying to avoid
healthy tissue. This tactic allows for safer,
higher doses of radiation.

It may take several months to 2 years to
restore the erectile function you had before the
prostatectomy. However, you may never regain
the same “mojo” you once had. Treatment
options for erectile dysfunction include pills (like
Viagra and Cialis), injections of medication into
the penis, vacuum constriction devices (“penis
pump”), and surgical implants that produce an
erection.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2022

Several types of EBRT are used for treating
prostate cancer:

45



Stereotactic body radiation therapy
(SBRT) uses high-energy radiation
beams to treat cancers in fewer
treatments.



Three-dimensional conformal radiation
therapy (3D-CRT) uses computer
software and CT images to aim beams
that match the shape of the tumor.



Intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT) uses small beams of different

movements. This spares normal tissues
from radiation damage.

strengths to match the shape of the
tumor. IMRT is a type of 3D-CRT that may
be used for more aggressive prostate
cancer.


Proton beam radiation therapy uses
streams of particles called protons to
precisely kill tumor cells.



Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT)
uses a computer to create a picture of the
tumor. This image guides the radiation
beam accurately during treatment,
even when internal organs make slight

Brachytherapy

Brachytherapy is an internal form of radiation
therapy. In this treatment, radiation is delivered
inside the body by placing a radioactive object
into or next to the tumor. You might hear it
called brachy (said “bray-key”) for short.
Brachytherapy may be used alone or
combined with EBRT, androgen deprivation

External beam radiation therapy
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s). The radiation beam focuses directly on the cancer while trying to avoid
healthy tissue. This tactic allows for safer, higher doses of radiation.

therapy (ADT), or both. Brachytherapy alone
may be an option for very-low-, low-, or
favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer,
depending on life expectancy. Patients with
high-risk cancers aren’t usually considered for
brachytherapy alone.

Urinary and bowel problems usually go away
after several weeks for most people, though
not for all. Erectile dysfunction also sometimes
occurs. Feeling very tired for a few weeks
to months after radiation treatment is also
common.

There are 2 types of brachytherapy:




Low dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy
uses tiny radioactive metal “seeds”
that are implanted into your prostate.
Each seed is about the size of a grain
of rice. They’re inserted into your body
through the perineum and guided into
your prostate with imaging. The seeds
usually consist of either radioactive
iodine or palladium. They’ll stay in your
prostate permanently and provide a low
dose of radiation continuously for a few
months. The radiation travels a very short
distance. This allows for a large amount
of radiation within a small area while
sparing nearby healthy tissue. Over time,
the seeds will stop radiating but will stay
in your body.

Hormone therapy
Hormone therapy is treatment that adds,
blocks, or removes hormones. A hormone is a
natural chemical made by a gland in the body.
Its job is to activate cells or organs.
Male hormones are called androgens. The
main androgen is testosterone. Most of the
testosterone in the body is made by the
testicles. Testosterone helps prostate cancer
to grow. A type of hormone therapy called
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can stop
your body from making testosterone or block
cancer cells from using testosterone. This can
shrink the tumor or slow tumor growth for a
period of time.

High dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy
uses thin tubes called catheters placed
inside your prostate gland. Thin needles
with radioactive tips are then inserted
through the catheters for a very short
time. High-dose radiation is delivered
through these needles. After treatment,
the needles and catheters are removed.

Hormone therapy is rarely used by itself for the
treatment of early-stage prostate cancer. It’s
usually given with radiation therapy.
You might hear the term “castration” used
when describing prostate cancer or its
treatment. This term describes a drastic
reduction of testosterone. Castration can be a
short-term reversable treatment using drugs
or it can be permanent surgical removal of
one or both testicles (orchiectomy). Though
orchiectomy is a surgical procedure, it’s

Side effects of radiation therapy
Common side effects of radiation therapy
are urinary problems and bowel problems.
Urinary problems include incontinence as
well as having to go more often, having to go
suddenly, and a burning sensation when you
go. Bowel problems can include diarrhea,

still considered hormone therapy because
it removes the primary testosterone source
(the testicles). Unlike drug hormone therapy,
orchiectomy can’t be reversed.

Systemic drug hormone therapies for prostate
cancer include luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) agonists and LHRH
antagonists, both of which cause the testicles
to stop making testosterone.

Subcapsular orchiectomy is a version of this
procedure but only the tissue that makes
testosterone is removed, not the testicles.

Most LHRH agonists and LHRH antagonists
are injections. These may be given monthly
or 2, 3, or 4 times a year. Anti-androgens,
corticosteroids, and androgen synthesis

Surgical removal of the testicles is much less
common nowadays because drug therapy is
often just as effective at blocking testosterone.

Brachytherapy radiation
Low dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy uses tiny radioactive metal “seeds” that are implanted
into your prostate. Each seed is about the size of a grain of rice. They’ll stay in your prostate
permanently and provide a low dose of radiation continuously for a few months. This treatment
strategy spares nearby healthy tissue from unnecessary radiation.

inhibitors are available as pills and taken 1 to
3 times a day, depending on the medication.

Other side effects of ADT include hot flashes,
mood changes, fatigue, weight gain, and
growth and tenderness of your breasts.

Side effects of hormone therapy
Hormone therapy has significant side
effects. Many factors affect your risk for
side effects including your age, your health
before treatment, how long or often you have
treatment, and so forth.

ADT increases the risk for diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. If you already have
either of these conditions, ADT can cause
them to get worse. In Black males, ADT may
increase the risk of death from heart issues.

See Guide 5.

Talk to your care team about how to manage
the side effects of hormone therapy. They
have ways to lessen or soothe some of these
problems.

Side effects differ among the types of hormone
therapy. In general, ADT may reduce your
desire for sex and may cause hot flashes and
erectile dysfunction.
The longer you take ADT, the greater your
risk for thinning and weakening bones
(osteoporosis), bone fractures, weight gain,
loss of muscle mass, diabetes, and heart
disease.

Chemotherapy | Clinical trials

Chemotherapy

Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

Chemotherapy is a drug therapy that damages
rapidly dividing cells throughout the body.
Because cancer cells divide and multiply
rapidly, they’re a good target for chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy can harm healthy cells, too.
That’s why chemotherapy can cause side
effects.
The only chemotherapy drug currently used
to treat early prostate cancer is docetaxel.
Docetaxel is used along with hormone therapy
in patients with very-high-risk prostate cancer.
Though docetaxel can’t cure prostate cancer,
it can help people live longer as well as reduce
their pain and other symptoms.

Clinical trials



Phase I trials study the dose, safety, and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.



Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.



Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.



Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Another avenue of treatment is a clinical trial.
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Who can enroll?

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Clinical trials give people access
to options that they couldn’t usually receive
otherwise. Talk to your doctor about whether a
clinical trial makes sense for you.

Informed consent

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2022

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in certain ways
in order to compare how they respond to a
specific treatment.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read

Start the conversation

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you’ve
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks aren’t well understood by
many with cancer.

Worldwide

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are hardly ever used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It’s common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with a
standard treatment. You’ll be informed, verbally
and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical
trial before you enroll.

Are clinical trials free?
There’s no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. However, you may
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. Depending on the
trial, you may continue to receive standard
cancer care. The standard therapy is billed
to—and often covered by—insurance. You’re
responsible for copays and any costs for this
care that aren’t covered by your insurance.

Prostate cancer treatment

Key points

Key points


Because surgery and radiation therapy
have similar long-term cure rates,
it’s important to see both a radiation
oncologist and a urologist to discuss
which treatment approach is right for you.



Observation looks for signs of cancer in
order to treat the symptoms before they
start or get worse. Treatment, if needed,
focuses on palliative care or symptom
relief instead of trying to cure the cancer.



Active surveillance involves frequent
testing, including biopsies, to see whether
the cancer is progressing in order to cure
it before it can get worse.



Active surveillance is the preferred
strategy for patients with lower-risk
prostate cancer and a longer life
expectancy.



Surgery removes the tumor along with
some normal-looking tissue around its
edge called a surgical margin. The goal of
surgery is a negative margin (R0).



A radical prostatectomy removes the
whole prostate, the surrounding tissue,
and the seminal vesicles.



Side effects of a radical prostatectomy
can include urinary incontinence and
erectile dysfunction.



Radiation kills cancer cells or stops new
cancer cells from being made.



Hormone therapy treats prostate cancer
by either stopping testosterone from being
made or blocking cancer cells from using
testosterone.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2022

Castration describes a drastic reduction of
testosterone. This can be done surgically
or with drugs.

A clinical trial studies a treatment to see
how safe it is and how well it works.
Sometimes, a clinical trial is the preferred
treatment option for prostate cancer.

Initial treatment options for prostate
cancer are based on your risk
assessment. Together, you and your
doctor will choose a treatment plan that
is best for you.

Patients included in the very-low-risk group
have all of the following traits:

Your doctor might suspect you have prostate
cancer based on an abnormal digital rectal
exam or an elevated PSA. Biopsies of the
prostate are needed to confirm prostate
cancer. A pathologist will assign a primary
and secondary Gleason grade to the biopsy
sample.

NCCN experts are concerned about
overtreatment of this early cancer. As a result,
very-low-risk prostate cancer isn’t treated with
hormone therapy or other types of systemic
therapy. Treatment options are based on life
expectancy. See Guide 6.

In addition to blood, imaging, and tissue
tests, a family history will be taken. Your life
expectancy will be estimated. You may have
genetic testing. All of these factors will be used
to place you into a risk group.

Active surveillance
Active surveillance consists of testing on
a regular basis, including biopsies, so that
treatment can be started when and if needed.
To see if you’re a good candidate for active
surveillance, you may need a confirmatory
mpMRI (if you haven’t received an MRI
already) with or without a confirmatory
prostate biopsy. All patients should have a
confirmatory prostate biopsy 1 to 2 years after
their initial biopsy. Tests required during active
surveillance are shown in Guide 7.

Adverse features

Radiation therapy
While active surveillance is preferred, radiation
therapy is also an option. Very-low-risk
cancers can be treated with external beam
radiation therapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy.
Prostate surgery
Surgery to remove the prostate (radical
prostatectomy) is an another option.
When your prostate is removed, a sample
will be sent to a pathologist to see how much
cancer there is. After surgery, your PSA level
will be tested. Radiation or systemic therapy
might follow surgery.
If you choose to have a radical prostatectomy,
your doctor will look for signs of disease
called adverse (or high-risk) features during
and after surgery. If your prostate cancer has
adverse features, then EBRT or observation
are adjuvant therapy options. Adjuvant therapy
is treatment after surgery that helps to stop
the cancer from returning. EBRT targets areas
where the cancer cells have likely spread.
Hormone therapy (androgen deprivation
therapy, or ADT) might also be added to EBRT.
Treatment will be started after you’ve healed
from the prostate operation.
If test results don’t find high-risk features, then
no more treatment is needed.

good candidates for active surveillance.

If you have favorable intermediate-risk prostate
cancer and your life expectancy is between 5
and 10 years, there are 2 treatment options:

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a treatment option for
some patients with favorable-intermediate
risk. Radiation treatment includes EBRT or
brachytherapy.

Observation
Observation is the preferred option for those
with a life expectancy of 5 to 10 years and
whose prostate cancer is unlikely to cause
problems. Observation involves occasional
PSA tests and watching for symptoms, which
can be treated with palliative therapy.

Prostate surgery
If you’re expected to live 10 or more years,
surgically removing your prostate (radical
prostatectomy) may be an option. When your
prostate is removed, a sample will be sent to
a pathologist to see how far the cancer has
spread. Your PSA will also be tested.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a treatment option
for some with favorable-intermediate
risk. Radiation therapy includes EBRT or
brachytherapy.

Your pelvic lymph nodes may also be removed
if the risk for cancer spreading to them is
2 percent (2%) or higher. Your doctor will
determine this risk using a nomogram. This
procedure is called a pelvic lymph node
dissection (PLND).

Life expectancy: 10 or more years

If you have favorable intermediate-risk prostate
cancer and your life expectancy is 10 or more
years, there are 3 options:

After prostate surgery, you might have
adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy is treatment
after surgery that helps to stop the cancer
from returning. Adjuvant therapy options
are based on whether there are high-risk
(adverse) features and cancer in the lymph
nodes (metastasis). Adverse features suggest
that not all of the cancer was removed during
surgery.

Active surveillance
Active surveillance consists of testing on a
regular basis so that treatment can be started
when needed. For favorable intermediaterisk disease, you should be watched closely
for any changes. To see if you’re a good
candidate for active surveillance, you may
need a confirmatory mpMRI (if you haven’t
received an MRI already) with or without
a confirmatory prostate biopsy and/or a
molecular tumor analysis.

If your prostate cancer has adverse features
and no lymph node metastases, the adjuvant
therapy options are EBRT or observation.
EBRT targets areas where the cancer
cells have likely spread. Hormone therapy
(androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT) might
be added to EBRT. ADT is used to suppress or
block the amount of testosterone in the body.

following:

dissection (PLND).

If you have unfavorable intermediate-risk
prostate cancer and your life expectancy is 5
to 10 years, your treatment options include:

You may receive more treatment after surgery.
This is called adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant
therapy is treatment given after a primary
treatment, like surgery in this case, to help
stop the cancer from returning. Adjuvant
therapy options are based on high-risk
(adverse) features and lymph node metastasis.
Adverse features suggest that not all of the
cancer was removed during surgery.

Observation
Because the cancer may progress too slowly
to cause problems within 5 to 10 years,
active surveillance is not recommended for
patients in this risk group. Observation is the
recommended option instead. Observation
involves occasional PSA tests and watching for
symptoms, which can be treated with palliative
therapy.

If there are adverse features but no lymph
node metastases, then the adjuvant options
include EBRT (with or without ADT) and
observation. EBRT targets areas where the
cancer cells have likely spread. ADT might
be added to EBRT. Treatment will be started
after you’ve healed from your prostate surgery.
Observation is the other adjuvant option. But if
there’s a rise in PSA level during observation,
radiation therapy may be started.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is another treatment option
for those in the unfavorable-intermediate
risk group. Treatment includes EBRT with
or without brachytherapy. Your doctor may
want to also add 4 to 6 months of ADT to your
radiation therapy.

If cancer is found in lymph nodes, treatment
options include ADT (with or without EBRT)
or observation. Observation is an option, but
radiation therapy may be started if there’s a
rise in PSA level. If test results find no adverse
features, no lymph node metastases, and a
low or undetectable PSA, then you may start
observation.

Life expectancy: 10 or more years

If you have unfavorable intermediate-risk
prostate cancer and your life expectancy is 10
or more years, your treatment options include:
Prostate surgery
If you’re expected to live 10 years or more,
surgically removing your prostate (radical
prostatectomy) may be an option. When your
prostate is removed, a sample will be sent to
a pathologist to see how far the cancer has
spread. Your PSA level will also be tested.

Radiation therapy
Another treatment option for those with
unfavorable intermediate risk is radiation
therapy. The most appropriate radiation
therapy is EBRT, which can be enhanced
with 4 to 6 months of ADT. Or EBRT can be
reinforced with brachytherapy, with or without
the option of 4 to 6 months of ADT.

Your pelvic lymph nodes may also be removed
if the risk for cancer spreading to them is
2 percent (2%) or higher. Your doctor will
determine this risk using a nomogram. This

Initial treatment by risk group

High risk or very high risk
Life expectancy: More than 5 years or

Those who have high-risk or very-high-risk
cancer and are expected to live 5 years or
less should undergo bone imaging. If cancer is
suspected in the lymph nodes, then you might
have imaging of your abdomen and/or pelvis.

If your life expectancy is more than 5 years or
you have symptoms, there are 3 options:
Radiation therapy
EBRT combined with long-term hormone
therapy is an effective initial treatment for
patients at high risk or very high risk. For this
option, ADT is given before, during, and after
radiation therapy for 18 months to 3 years.
ADT alone is not enough.

Treatment options are based on life
expectancy and whether or not you have
symptoms.

Life expectancy: 5 years or less and
no symptoms

There are 3 options for high-risk or very-highrisk prostate cancer when life expectancy is 5
years or less and there are no symptoms:

The other option is EBRT, brachytherapy,
and long-term ADT. Combining EBRT and
brachytherapy allows for more careful control
of the radiation dose. When ADT is added to
this combination, patient outcomes tend to
improve.

Observation
Observation is the option for most people in
these high-risk groups. Observation involves
occasional PSA tests and watching for
symptoms, which can be treated with palliative
therapy.

Prostate surgery
If you’re expected to live more than 5 years,
a radical prostatectomy with the removal of
your pelvic lymph nodes (PLND) is an option
for patients in the high-risk group and certain
patients in the very-high-risk group. Your age
and overall health will be a factor in deciding if
this is a good option for you.

Hormone therapy
If observation isn’t a good fit, androgen
deprivation therapy is an option. Hormone
therapy (ADT) can be surgical or medical
castration. Surgery to remove the testicles is
called an orchiectomy. Other forms of ADT are
systemic therapies (drugs).

During the operation, the prostate tissue
is removed from your body and sent to a
pathologist to see how far the cancer has
spread. After the operation, your PSA level will
also be tested.

Radiation therapy
EBRT is an option because it’s been shown to
be effective in patients with high-risk and veryhigh-risk prostate cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2022

You may receive more treatment after prostate
surgery. This is called adjuvant treatment.
Adjuvant treatment helps to stop the cancer
from returning. Options for adjuvant treatment
after a prostatectomy are based on the
presence of adverse (high-risk) features and
cancer in the lymph nodes. If test results find

no adverse features or cancer in the lymph
nodes, no more treatment is needed. Your
cancer will be monitored. If test results find
adverse features but no cancer in the lymph
nodes, options are EBRT (with or without ADT)
or observation.

If your initial treatment was successful, you’ll
be monitored to make sure the cancer hasn’t
returned (recurrence). Monitoring involves
these follow-up tests:

EBRT targets areas where the cancer cells
have likely spread. Treatment will be started
after you’ve healed from the prostate surgery.
ADT might be added to EBRT to improve
outcomes.
If cancer is found in lymph nodes, then the
options are ADT (with or without EBRT) or
observation. The first option is to start ADT
right away with the option of adding EBRT.



PSA every 6 to 12 months for 5 years,
then once a year after that. (For patients
with a high risk of recurrence, PSA testing
every 3 months may be better.)



Digital rectal exam every 12 months
(which may be skipped if your PSA level
is undetectable after treatment).

If lymph node metastases (N1) are found while
you’re on ADT or observation, then you’ll have
these follow-up tests:

If your PSA levels are undetectable,
observation may be a safer option. If PSA
levels rise during observation, then palliative
care with ADT can be started.



Physical exam with a PSA every 3 to 6
months

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice

It’s important to be comfortable with
the cancer treatment you choose. This
choice starts with having an open and
honest conversation with your doctor.

Second opinion

It’s normal to want to start treatment as
soon as possible. While cancer shouldn’t
be ignored, there is time to have another
doctor review your test results and suggest a
treatment plan. This is called getting a second
opinion, and it’s a normal part of cancer care.
Even doctors get second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What’s
important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you’ll see for
your second opinion.

Support groups

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.

Questions to ask your doctors
Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these or come up with your own. Be clear about
your goals for treatment and find out what to
expect from treatment. Keep a notebook handy
to record answers to your questions.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
If you build a relationship with your doctor, it
will help you feel supported when considering
options and making treatment decisions.
