Background & Methodology

4

Introduction
• Penile cancer is a rare disease, but it has a significant impact on QoL in many ways.
• Patients not only suffer the psychological and emotional stress of a cancer diagnosis and
what that means for the rest of their lives, but also the psychological impact and stigma of
cancer on an intimate part of the body.
• The Guideline Panel strongly recommends that these emotional, social, and physical
needs are discussed and addressed early in the patient pathway, through a holistic and
multi-disciplinary approach.
• This guideline is the result of a collaboration between the EAU and the ASCO, presenting
a complete revision of the prior version(s), with the aim to offer worldwide physician and
patient guidance in the management of this rare disease.

▪ a systematic literature review by guidelines staff
▪ an expert panel provides critical review and evidence interpretation to inform
guideline recommendations
▪ final guideline approval by EAU Guidelines Office Board and ASCO EBMC

Summary of Recommendations
Diagnostic Evaluation and Staging Recommendations:
Primary Tumor

Strength of
Recommendation

• Perform a detailed physical examination of the penis and external genitalia,
recording morphology, size and location of the penile lesion, including extent and
invasion of penile (adjacent) structures.

Strong

• Perform MRI of the penis/primary tumour (artificial erection not mandatory) when
there is uncertainty regarding corporal invasion and/or the feasibility of (organsparing) surgery. If MRI is not available, offer US as alternative option.

Weak

• Obtain a pre-treatment biopsy of the primary lesion when malignancy is not
clinically obvious, or when non-surgical treatment of the primary lesion is planned
(e.g., topical agents, laser, radiotherapy).

Summary of Recommendations
Follow-Up and Quality of Life

Strength of
Recommendation

• Deliver penile cancer care as part of an extended multi-disciplinary team
comprising of urologists specialising in penile cancer, specialist nurses,

teams for early symptom control, reconstructive surgeons, vascular surgeons,
sex therapists.

Strong

• Follow-up men after penile cancer treatment, initially three-monthly for 2 years
then less frequently to assess for recurrent disease and to offer patient support
services through the extended multi-disciplinary team. At discharge, recommend
self-examination with easy access back to the clinic as local recurrence can
occur late.

Follow-Up and Quality of Life (continued)
• Discuss the psychological impact of penile cancer and its treatments with the
patient and offer psychological support and counselling services.
• Discuss the negative impact of treatments for the primary tumour on penile
appearance, sensation, urinary and sexual function so that the patient is better
prepared for the challenges he may face.
• Discuss the potential impact of lymphoedema as a consequence of inguinal and
pelvic lymph node treatment with the patient and assess patients for it at follow-up
and refer to lymphoedema therapists early.
